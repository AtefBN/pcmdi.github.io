# Detection and Attribution

#### [Detection and Attribution Research][DandA]
PCMDI has led research into the detection and attribution of the causes of climate-change. This work has considered a wide-range of changes to the global climate system and included analyses of atmospheric temperature, precipitable water, ocean heat content and other key aspects of the climate system

# Climate Model Diagnosis

#### [Diagnosis of Climate Models][Diagnosis]
PCMDIâ€™s mission is to develop improved methods and tools for the diagnosis and evaluation of climate models. Although models have become increasingly complex, model errors and disagreements among model simulations remain substantial and poorly understood. The nature and causes of these disagreements should be uncovered before the models are fully trusted to inform us about global climate change.

# Climate Model Metrics

#### [Diagnosis of Climate Model Performance][Metrics]
The PCMDI metrics package is used to objectively compare results from climate models with observations using well-established statistical tests. Results are produced in the context of all model simulations contributed to CMIP5 and earlier CMIP phases
