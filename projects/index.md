# Model Intercomparison

#### [AMIP - Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project][AMIP]
AMIP is a standard experimental protocol for global atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). It provides a community-based infrastructure in support of climate model diagnosis, validation, intercomparison, documentation and data access.  This framework enables a diverse community of scientists to analyze AGCMs in a systematic fashion, a process which serves to facilitate model improvement.  Virtually the entire [international climate modeling community][icmc] has participated in this project since its inception in 1990.

#### [CMIP - Coupled Model Intercomparison Project][CMIP] 
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) studies output from coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models that also include interactive sea ice.  These models allow the simulated climatls e to adjust to changes in climate forcing, such as increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.  CMIP began in 1995 by collecting output from model "control runs" in which climate forcing is held constant.  Later versions of CMIP have collected output from an idealized scenario of global warming, with atmospheric CO2 increasing at the rate of 1% per year until it doubles at about Year 70.  CMIP output is available for study by approved diagnostic sub-projects.  The WCRP CMIP3 multi-model dataset archived at PCMDI, included realistic scenarios for both past and present climate forcing.  The research based on this dataset has provided much of the new material underlying the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4). The ongoing [WCRP CMIP5][CMIP5] experiment will be the bases for the upcoming IPCC AR5 scheduled for 2013.
