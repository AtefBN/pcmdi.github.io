1995a: Intraseasonal oscillations in 15 atmospheric general circulation
models: Results from AMIP diagnostic Subproject No. 1. Abstracts of the
First International AMIP Scientific Conference, Monterey, California, 59.&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>This paper will describe the results of a study to assess the ability
of 15 participating GCMs to simulate the tropical intraseasonal oscillation.
Time series of the daily upper tropospheric velocity potential and zonal
wind, averaged over the equatorial belt, were provided from each GCM. These
data were analyzed using a variety of techniques such as time filtering
and space-time spectral analysis to identify eastward and westward moving
waves. The results have been compared with an identical assessment of ECMWF
analyses for the period 1982-1991.

<P>The models display a wide range of skill in simulating the intraseasonal
oscillation. Most models show evidence of an eastward propagating anomaly
in the velocity potential field, although in some models there is a greater
tendency for a standing oscillation, and in one or two the field is rather
chaotic with no preferred direction of propagation. Where a model has a
clear eastward propagating signal, typical periodicities seem quite reasonable
although there is a tendency for the models to simulate shorter periods
than in the ECMWF analyses, where it is near 50 days. The results of the
space-time spectral analysis have shown that no model has captured the
dominance of the intraseasonal oscillation in the analyses. Several models
have peaks at intraseasonal time scales, but nearly all have relatively
more power at higher frequencies (&lt;30 days) than the analyses. Most
models underestimate the strength of the intraseasonal variability.

<P>The observed intraseasonal oscillation shows a marked seasonality in
its occurrence with greatest activity during northern winter and spring.
Most models failed to capture this seasonality. The interannual variability
in the activity of the intraseasonal oscillation has also been assessed,
although the AMIP decade is to short to provide any conclusive results.
There is a suggestion that the observed oscillation is suppressed during
an El Ni&ntilde;o, and this relationship is also reproduced by some models.

<P>The relationship between a model's intraseasonal activity, its seasonal
cycle and characteristics of its basic climate has been examined. It is
clear that those models with weak intraseasonal activity tend also to have
a weak seasonal cycle. It is becoming increasingly evident that an accurate
description of the basic climate may be a prerequisite for producing a
realistic intraseasonal oscillation. In particular, models with the most
realistic intraseasonal oscillations appear to have precipitation distributions
which are well correlated with warm sea surface temperatures. These models
predominantly employ convective parameterizations which are closed on buoyancy
rather than moisture convergence.
