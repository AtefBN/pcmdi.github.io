<B>Park, C.-K. </B>and S. Schubert, 1995: Interannual and subseasonal
variations of the summer monsoon during the ENSO cycle (GSFC/GEOS). Abstracts
of the First International AMIP Scientific Conference, Monterey, California,

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The prediction of monsoon rainfall is a challenging task in the modeling
community because of the complexities associated with the thermal and mechanical
effects of high mountain terrain and the land/sea contrast interacting
with the seasonal cycle. While the monsoon evolution is largely phase-locked
with the seasonal cycle, the interannual variations of the intensity and
arrival of the monsoon are yet to be understood. The Data Assimilation
Office (DAO) in the Goddard Space Flight Center/NASA has recently produced
a five-year global analysis employing a fixed assimilation system. The
Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) analysis dataset is used to evaluate
the GEOS GCM simulation of the contrasting dynamical and thermodynamical
characteristics of the Indian summer monsoon during the extreme monsoon
years.

<P>The years 1986/87 were characterized by a major El Ni&ntilde;o event
which was followed by a strong La Ni&ntilde;a in 1988 characterized by
cold SST anomalies in the tropical eastern Pacific. An apparent coupling
between El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the monsoons manifested
itself during these years by a drought in 1987 and flood in 1988 over the
Indian summer monsoon region. The possible connection of the ENSO with
the abnormal drought/flood conditions in the Asian summer monsoon region
is examined in the GEOS analyses and the simulation. The impact of lower
boundary forcing both on the subseasonal monsoon evolution and the low-frequency
tropical oscillations is examined for two contrasting Pacific basin-wide
warm/cold episodes. The characteristics of the barotropic energy conversion
during these two extreme monsoon periods are of interest. This study will
identify the different characteristics of low-frequency wave propagation
associated with the excursion of heat sources in the course of the monsoon
evolution.
