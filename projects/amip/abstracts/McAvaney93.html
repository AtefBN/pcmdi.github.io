<BR>In this paper we present an outline of the configuration of the BMRC
Atmospheric General Circulation Model used for the 1979-1988 Atmospheric
Model Intercomparison Project experiment. We present details of the parameterizations
used, the parameter settings chosen, and the method of initializing external
boundary fields. We hope that by collecting all such details into this
single source document we will assist those who wish to analyze the output
from the BMRC AGCM simulation.
