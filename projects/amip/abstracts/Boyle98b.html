<b>Boyle, J. S.,</b> 1998b: Intercomparison of interannual
variability of the global 200-hPa circulation for AMIP simulations.&nbsp;
<i>Journal of Climate,</i> <b>11, </b>pp. 2505–2529.
<br>
<hr align=LEFT width="100%"><font size=+0>The 200-hPa divergence and streamfunction
from the 30 models of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP)
are compared. The data used are in the form of monthly averages and are
filtered to a spatial resolution of T10, although the actual spatial resolution
of the models varies from R15 to T42. The tools of the analysis are principal
components analysis (PCA) and common principal components (CPC). These
analyses are carried out on the 120 months of data with the climatological
annual cycle removed and in the case of the streamfunction with the zonal
average also removed. The AMIP period (1979–88) encompasses two El Ni&ntilde;o–Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) events (1982–83 and 1986–87), and as could be expected
the ENSO characteristic response has a prominent impact in the model simulations.</font>
<blockquote><font size=+0>The
results indicate the following.</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font size=+0>The PCA of the divergence has a dominant mode that is similar
for all the models and has the signature of an ENSO response. It has an
east–west dipole of divergence anomaly centered on the equator in the western
Pacific. The streamfunction PC analysis also exhibits an ENSO-type response
as the dominant mode, but this accounts for only 8%–21% of the variance.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+0>The CPC analysis allows a direct comparison of the data from
all the models on a common set of vectors. These results indicate that
the models share a basic common pattern but there is a strong variation
in the amplitude of the corresponding modes. There is less commonality
in the higher components for the CPC streamfunction than seen in the divergence.
This appears to be related to the stronger streamfunction response in the
midlatitudes, which is presumably more affected by nonlinearity and intrinsic
variability of the model integrations.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+0>Based on results using an ensemble of five decadal runs using
the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF) GCM an estimate
is made of the variation of explained variance due to intrinsic variability
for a single model. It is found that in general the intermodel variation
is somewhat greater than the intramodel ensemble variation using the ECMWF
model.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+0>A probability density function (PDF) analysis in the space
spanned by the first two CPCs for the velocity potential (which explain
over 70% of the variance for all but one model) yields distinctive dynamical
signatures. Some models populate a somewhat larger PDF space than others.</font></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<font size=+0>There is an implication that the models differ beyond the
variations due to intrinsic variability in the dynamical system. Some of
the models have distinctly different responses to a common SST forcing.
The disparate results indicate that consensus on the representation of
the physics of the atmosphere has not been reached, and the present uncertainty
in the parameterizations is greater than the intrinsic uncertainty of the
model system as shown by ensemble simulations.</font>
