<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>In this publication we present some results of numerical experiments
which have been carried out with a new version of the DNM GCM. The previous
version of this model (see Phillips, 1994) unfortunately contained incorrect
code for the calculation of the vertical velocity. The consequences of
this error and results of its correction are described here.
