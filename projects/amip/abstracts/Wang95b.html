<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>A workshop, "General circulation model simulation of East Asian Climate"
was held October 18-20, 1994 at the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center,
State University of New York at Albany. The workshop was attended by fourteen
scientists from five groups, 1995: several graduate students from SUNYA
also participated. Two sessions were organized: the first session (one-day)
consisted of presentations of GCM simulations and diagnosis of East Asian
climate from the individual groups, 1995: the second session (two-days)
included discussion and writing of the workshop document for the planning
of future research. The participating groups agreed to hold the Second
Workshop, tentatively scheduled for October 17-19, 1995, in Taipei. National
Taiwan University will host the Workshop.

<P>The following three studies have been agreed upon by the participants
and preliminary results will be presented in the 15-19 May 1995 AMIP Scientific
Conference to be held in Monterey, California.

<P>First, both GCM simulations and observations will be analyzed to examine
the characteristics relevant to the climatological mean evolution of the
EAC, including the seasonal march of western Pacific subtropical high,
the south Asian high, the Siberian high, and the onset and retreat of East
Asian monsoon. Seasonal and monthly mean states of the model climate will
be documented to examine the simulated annual cycle of the model. The quantities
include general circulation and precipitation statistics. The spatial and
frequency distributions of simulated variance will also be documented to
understand simulated climate variabilities in the East Asian and Western
Pacific regions. In addition, the evolution of atmospheric circulation
will be diagnosed with focus on the abrupt changes identified with the
monsoon. Similar analyses will be carried out using ECWMF and CCM2 simulations.

<P>Second, an ensemble of full AMIP runs with different initial conditions
will be conducted and the permutation procedure/correlation method used
to study EAC predictability. The signal/noise statistics will be analyzed
to substantiate significance of results. Third, the sensitivity of EAC
to model horizontal resolution will be explored.
