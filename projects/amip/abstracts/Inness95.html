<BR>There is a wide spectrum of time and space scales for the variability
of tropical convection, ranging from small cloud clusters embedded in easterly
waves, with a period of a few days, up to ENSO events with a period of
several years. An important mode of variability is that which occurs on
an intraseasonal (25 to 60 day) period, with an eastward propagating disturbance
which enhances convective activity being observed in the atmosphere. The
Indian Monsoon and convective activity in the West Pacific are strongly
modulated on this period, and the variability of organized tropical convection
on an intraseasonal period is thought to be important in the excitation
of planetary waves with teleconnections to extra-tropical latitudes. Thus
an accurate representation of this mode is important in numerical models
which are being used for forecasting on a range of timescales, and in models
being used for long term climate simulation and climate change prediction.
There is also observational evidence that the strength of this intraseasonal
mode is modulated on an interannual timescale which seems to be linked
to ENSO.

<P>The character of the intraseasonal (Madden-Julian) oscillation in the
Hadley Centre Unified Model has been analyzed in the UKMO AMIP integration.
The model is shown to produce a reasonably realistic oscillation signal,
although in common with other GCMs, the dominant period of the oscillation
is slightly too fast and the signal is somewhat noisy. The oscillation
in the model also shows a degree of interannual variability, the oscillation
being enhanced during the onset phase of ENSO and suppressed during the
mature and decay phases, in agreement with observational studies. This
result may provide an important insight into the mechanisms involved in
the generation and maintenance of the Madden-Julian oscillation. The strength
of the oscillation is also seen to be sensitive to changes in the convective
parameterization used in the model. The implementation of a convective
momentum transport scheme, whilst giving improvements in several aspects
of the mean circulation of the model, is seen to destroy the simulation
of the Madden-Julian oscillation.
