<B>Arpe, K.,</B> L. Bengtsson and E. Roeckner, 1995: Impacts of observed
SST on the atmospheric circulation in the ECHAM simulations. Abstracts
of the First International AMIP Scientific Conference, Monterey, California,
104.

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>Impacts of observed SST on the atmospheric circulation will be shown
by investigating 5 extended AMIP simulations with the ECHAM3/T42 model.
As far as possible the impacts in the simulations will be verified by observations.
The stability of these findings will then be investigated by studying simulations
with a more recent version of our model - ECHAM4. We will also address
some simulations with different resolution.
