<B>Randall, D.A.</B> and P. Gleckler, 1995b: Diagnosis of simulated
ocean surface heat fluxes and the implied partitioning of meridional heat
transport between the atmosphere and ocean (Diagnostic Subproject 5). Abstracts
of the First International AMIP Scientific Conference, Monterey, California,
15.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">A variety of largely independent data sets will be used
to evaluate the seasonal cycle of the surface energy balance in the AMIP
simulations, including surface- and satellite-based observational products
and reanalyses. It will be shown that even after accounting for their large
uncertainties, the observations suggest several important systematic biases
in the simulated surface heat fluxes.

<P>The meridional oceanic heat transport implied by the models will also
be summarized. It will be demonstrated that the simulated surface energy
balance is extremely sensitive to the treatment of cloud-radiative effects,
to the extent that it may drastically affect a model's prospect of being
successfully coupled to an ocean GCM.
