<B>Boyle, J. S.,</B> 1995b: Estimates of zonally averaged tropical
diabatic heating in AMIP GCM simulations. PCMDI Report 25, Program for
Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, 39 pp.&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The vertical distribution of zonally and seasonally averaged diabatic
heating is estimated for 29 GCM AMIP decadal simulations using the thermodynamic
equation. Since only the zonally averaged, monthly means were available,
the transient and stationary wave components are not included in this budget.
The exclusion of these terms limits the useful analysis to the Tropics.
The vertically averaged values from the budget computation are compared
to the vertically averaged diabatic heating computed directly from the
sensible heat and radiative fluxes, and precipitation. The comparison is
quite favorable in the Tropics, with the effects of the neglected heat
fluxes becoming apparent at about 30&deg; poleward from the Equator. The
computations are carried out for the solstitial seasons. Based on the median
heating distribution of the 29 models we find the following: (1) The model
consensus of near equatorial heating is greater in magnitude and lower
(~500 mb) than that computed from the ECMWF analysis by Hoskins et al.
(1989). (2) The subtropical cooling tends to be greater in magnitude and
higher than the Hoskins et al. computation, although this will be affected
by the terms neglected in the budget computation. Consideration of the
individual model fields show that (3) there is a large variation in the
magnitude and distribution of the tropical diabatic heating amongst the
models. The magnitudes in the northern summer vary by more than a factor
of two. (4) the amount of seasonal asymmetry about the equator varies widely
among the models. For some models the heating maximum remains on the northern
side of the equator for both seasons. (5) It is evident that the interactions
among the many parameterizations and model formulations obscure any systematic
signature of a particular penetrative convective scheme. Finally, given
the differences in the heating distributions among the models for this
zonally-averaged, seasonally-averaged ten-year data set, it is clear that
there is not yet a consensus on the proper parameterization suite to simulate
this essential field.
