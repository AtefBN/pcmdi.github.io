<B>Meleshko, V. P.,</B> T. Pavlova and V. Govorkova, 1995: AMIP
simulation with the MGO GCM. Abstracts of the First International AMIP
Scientific Conference, Monterey, California, 98.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The major atmospheric quantities (air temperature, precipitation, cloudiness,
radiation balance at TOA, cloud-radiative forcing and SLP) and their seasonal
variation produced in AMIP simulation were analysed and compared with observation.
Some systematic errors inherent to the MGO GCM are discussed and ways of
decreasing some errors are considered and demonstrated from other simulations.
