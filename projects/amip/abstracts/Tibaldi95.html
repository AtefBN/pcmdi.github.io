<B>Tibaldi, S. </B>and F. D'Andrea, 1995: Preliminary results
from AMIP Subproject 10: Blocking diagnostics. Abstracts of the First International
AMIP Scientific Conference, Monterey, California, 77.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>A technique for validating General Circulation Models has been developed
in the framework of the AMIP subproject No. 10. This technique is based
on the diagnostics of the process of the atmospheric blocking. It computes
frequencies of blocking occurrence as function of longitude and seasonal
cycle, as well as blocking duration distribution and other statistical
and synoptic quantities. The diagnostic package is based on an objective
blocking index whose validity has been proved in previous works. Only a
part of the outputs of the models participating to AMIP has been analysed,
and the preliminary results will be presented here. Large differences in
the ability of reproducing blocking are found among the different models.
Some interpretation of these differences is attempted.
