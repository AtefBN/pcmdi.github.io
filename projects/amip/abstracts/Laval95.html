<BODY>
<B>Laval, K., </B>1995: Sensitivity of the monsoon to land-surface
processes in the LMD GCM. Abstracts of the First International AMIP Scientific
Conference, Monterey, California, 68.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>Numerical experiments with the LMD GCM have been carried out with two
different Lhomond parameterizations of land-surface processes. The first
one is the usual "bucket model" with a simple reservoir of soil moisture
and no vegetation. The second one is a scheme describing the different
types of vegetation, called SECHIBA.

<P>We describe the simulation of monsoon in both integrations, over the
period 1979-88. We analyse the differences obtained in the hydrological
cycle over the monsoon region. In order to try to understand the role of
land-surface processes in the monsoon evolution, additional integrations
for the wet and dry years have been performed.
