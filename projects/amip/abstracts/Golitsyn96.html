V. Galin, I. Mokhov, E.Volodin, 1996: Water balance components over the
Caspian watershed region as simulated by an ensemble of atmospheric general
circulaton models. Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics, Russian Academy of
Science (submitted).&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The International Program AMIP, aimed at intercomparison of physically
comprehensive atmospheric GCMs, provides a unique opportunity of assessing
ability of the modern models to simulate climates of different regions
of the Earth.

<P>In this paper, analysis is given of atmospheric water and thermal regime
components' seasonal cycles simulated by 21 GCMs over Caspian region (the
Volga/Ural river watersheds and the Caspian sea) including precipitation,
evaporation, snow mass, runoff, cloudiness, precipitable water, radiation
balance and surface temperature. The simulations are compared against observational
data. Simulations carried out by high- and low-resolution models are considered
separately.

<P>By estimating water balance over the land and sea watersheds, the sea
level change is determined for each model during the period 1979-1988.
These results are also compared against observation. Summer precipitation
and winter temperature interannual and seasonal anomalies are considered
over the watershed.

<P>In conclusion, a qualitative assessment is given of high- and low-resolution
models' ability to simulate the regional climate, as well as its seasonal
and interannual variations.
