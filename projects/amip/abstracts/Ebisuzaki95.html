<B>Ebisuzaki, W.,</B> 1995: The potential predictability in
a 14-year GCM simulation.<I> Journal of Climate</I>, 2749-2761.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">A 14-yr simulation of a GCM forced by observed SST and
sea ice is compared with observations as well as a GCM simulation that
used climatological surface conditions. The low frequency (periods > 2
months) behavior in both simulations and observations is examined, and
it is found that the anomalous boundary conditions were the cause of much
of the low-frequency variability in the simulations. Without the anomalous
boundary conditions, the low-frequency spectra was often flat, suggesting
that the internal variability was producing a white noise-like spectra.
The anomalous boundary conditions were found to be very important in determining
the low-frequency behavior of the model. If the future values of the SST
and sea ice were known, then the predictability for certain variables could
be quite high for low-frequency signals (periods > 8 months). Specific
zones showed predictability for low-frequency signals in excess of 70%
explained variance. These zones were often related to ENSO, as the Southern
Oscillation is the strongest intradecadal phenomenon that is forced by
the anomalous boundary conditions. This study gives a lower bound on the
variance explained by the anomalous surface forcings.
