<b>Duvel, J. P.</b>, S. Bonyl, H. Le Treut and Participating AMIP
Modelling Groups.&nbsp; 1997: Clear-sky greenhouse effect sensitivity to
sea surface temperature changes: an evaluation of AMIP simulations.
<i>Climate
Dynamics,</i> <b>13</b>, 259-273.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">Seasonal and interannual variations of the clear-sky greenhouse
effect (G) are analysed for 10 general circulation models (GCMs) participating
in the atmospheric model intercomparison project (AMIP). Results are compared
to ERBE observations between 1985 and 1988. In order to trace the source
of G variability, we also study modelled variability of the precipitable
water content (W) and compare the results to ISCCP/TOVS and SSM/I estimates.
For a subset of models, the variability of temperature and water vapor
profiles are also examined and compared to ECMWF analyses and NCEP/NCAR
reanalyses for the year 1988. Large differences between models and a bias
relative to observations are pointed out for annual mean values of W and
G as well as for their seasonal and interannual variabilities. The model
discrepancies are larger in the tropics. In these regions, there is a dry
bias in all the GCMs considered relative to both ISCCP/TOVS and SSM/I and
factors of 2 or 3 are found in the variability of G and W compared to observations.
The GCMs considered tend to overestimate the <i>seasonal </i>variation
of G in middle latitudes and to underestimate it in the tropics. The opposite
is found for interannual variations. Inspection of vertical temperature
and relative humidity profiles reveals that the origin of the clear-sky
greenhouse effect variability can be very different from one model to another.
