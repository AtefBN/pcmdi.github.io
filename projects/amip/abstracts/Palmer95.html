<B>Palmer, T. N.,</B> D. Battisti, C. Brankovic, R Buizza, Y.-Q.
Chen, and K. Sperber, 1995: Ensemble techniques for seasonal prediction.
Proceedings of the 1995 Tropical and Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Conference,
Melbourne, Australia.&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>As a legacy of the TOGA programme, it is likely that prediction of
interannual climate fluctuations using dynamically-based models will increasingly
become an operational activity in many countries. And yet we should remember
Tennekes et al's (1987) Popperian assertion that "no forecast is complete
without a forecast of forecast skill". The role that ensemble techniques
can play in estimating the predictability of seasonal forecasts is addressed
here through a series of questions. Within this discussion we will consider
the specific role that adjoint techniques can play in seasonal predictability
studies
