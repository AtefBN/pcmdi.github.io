<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Observational estimates of precipitation and evaporation over the Arctic
Ocean and its terrestrial watersheds are compared with corresponding values
from the climate model simulations of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison
Project (AMIP). Estimates of Arctic regional mean precipitation from several
observational sources show considerable scatter, and the observational
estimates based on gauge-adjusted station data are considerably larger
than the other observational estimates. While the AMIP model simulations
of precipitation also show scatter, the ensemble mean of the models' precipitation
exceeds even the higher (gauge-adjusted) observational estimates over the
Arctic Ocean and its major watersheds. The difference between simulated
precipitation and evaporation (P — E), representing the net freshwater
gain (runoff) by the surface, also exceeds the observational estimates
by 44%-83% over the Arctic Ocean and by generally smaller percentages over
the terrestrial watersheds. The ensemble model mean of the annual P — E
exceeds the corresponding river discharges of the Ob and Mackenzie Rivers
by 62% and 14%, respectively.

<P>The simulated P and E are highly correlated across the AMIP models,
and the interannual (as well as the seasonal) variations of P and E are
highly correlated in the output of most of the individual models, implying
a coupling of the regional P and E in the models. The only formulational
feature found to be common to the high-P (and high-E) models is the use
of a specified rather than a computed soil moisture. A preliminary examination
of the reanalyses of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction
shows that the differences between the reanalysis-derived P and E are closer
to the observational estimates than are the AMIP estimates. However, the
magnitudes of the reanalysis-derived P and E, individually, are higher
than the corresponding observational estimates.
