<B>Weare, B. C.</B>, 1996:&nbsp; Evaluation of the vertical structure of
zonally-averaged cloudiness and its variability in the Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Project.&nbsp; <I>Journal of Climate,</I> <B>9</B>, 3419-3431.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">Estimates of zonally averaged cloudiness at each pressure
level in 24 models participating in the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison
Project are compared with the ISCCP C2 as well as the Nimbus 7 (N7) and
Warren et al. (hereafter WH) observations. The global means of model high
cloudiness are about two to five times greater than the C2 satellite observations.
The large differences are probably related to excessive high, thin cloud
in most models. Nearly all of the models have the observed maximum in high
cloud at the equator, but also maxima near 60&deg;N and 60&deg;S, which
are not observed. The globally averaged annual mean low cloud in most models
is generally 15%20% less than the WH observations and 10%-15% less than
the C2 observations. The meridional structure of model annual mean low
cloud both as observed from below and as observed from above show excesses
north of about 50&deg;N and deficits south of about 40&deg;S when compared
with WH and C2 observations, respectively.

<P>The amplitude of the model seasonal cycle of high cloud in most cases
is comparable to that of the C2 observations. However, nearly all models
have tropical peaks in seasonal variability that are poleward of those
in the observations. In most models the variation of the seasonal cycle
of low cloud as observed from above differs considerably in both temporal
phase and spatial pattern from that of the C2 observations.
