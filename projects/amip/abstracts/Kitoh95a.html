<B>Kitoh, A.,</B> 1995a: Northern winter atmospheric variability
in the MRI AMIP run. Abstracts of the First International AMIP Scientific
Conference, Monterey, California, 79.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>Interannual atmospheric variability in the Northern Hemisphere in winter
with respect to tropical SST variations such as El Ni&ntilde;o is well
represented by many observational and modeling studies. In this paper we
first show that the MRI coupled GCM can reveal such an atmosphere-ocean
coupled mode as obtained by the singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis.
This mode is similar to the observed mode in the Pacific-North American
region in the past 47 years.

<P>The SVD analysis of the AMIP run with the MRI AGCM shows that the standard
model has a quite different mode to the observed for the period 1979-1988.
Differences are found over the western Pacific, over the Eurasian continent
and over the Arctic. A tuning of the gravity wave drag parameter yields
different model climatology, particularly for the subtropical jet in the
Pacific, and a teleconnection pattern in the Pacific/North American region.
However the simulated SVD modes are not so different from each other. The
tropospheric version of the model shows a response more similar to the
observed. These differences are discussed together with whether this 10-year
period can be used to verify the GCMs with respect to their performance
on interannual variability.
