<B>Covey, C., </B>1996: Correlation between outgoing longwave radiation
and surface temperature in the tropical Pacific: A Model Intercomparison.
PCMDI Report 30, Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison,
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 19 pp.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">Results from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project
show that general circulation models tend to underestimate the emission
of anomalous heat to space during the 1987 El Ni&ntilde;o episode in the
tropical Pacific. This bias suggests that the models may underestimate
negative feedbacks on climate involving longwave radiation in the tropical
atmosphere. Such a possibility is consistent with analyses of paleo-data
that suggest climate models generally overestimate climate sensitivity
in the tropics.
