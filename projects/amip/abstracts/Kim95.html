<B>Kim, J.-W. </B>and J.-H. Oh, 1995: Revisiting the AMIP with an
improved version of YONU GCM. Abstracts of the First International AMIP
Scientific Conference, Monterey, California, 93.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The YONU GCM has revisited the AMIP with its new version Tr7.0 in order
to remove the shortcomings of its earlier version Tr5.0 for simulating
the observations during the AMIP period (1979-1988). In particular, we
will discuss the outstanding features of simulated Southern Oscillations,
including the similarity between simulated and observed SOIs during the
period. We will also discuss the model climatology along with the outstanding
errors in the model results.
