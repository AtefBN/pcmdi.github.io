<B>Weare, B.</B> and I. Mokhov, 1995b: Evaluation of cloudiness
in the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (Diagnostic Subproject
13). Abstracts of the First International AMIP Scientific Conference, Monterey,
California, 18.&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">Estimates of cloudiness in the models participating in
the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project are compared with the ISCCP
C2, Nimbus 7, Meteor and Warren et al. (WH) observations. The root mean
square differences between the annual means of the model calculations and
the C2 observations, after global means are removed, are all greater than
14%, whereas the difference between the C2 and Meteor observations is less
than 8%. Calculations of smoothed seasonal cycles show that many models
simulate a seasonal cycle which leads that of the observations by about
two months. Other models appear to simulate the proper phase of the seasonal
cycle, but have spatial patterns which are in large disagreement with the
observations. The global means of model high cloudiness are about 2-6 times
greater than that of either of the satellite observations. The large differences
with observations and between models is probably primarily related to the
lack of a standard definition for what constitutes thin high cloud. The
mean low cloud as observed from below in most models is comparable to WH.
There is usually good qualitative agreement in the annual mean meridional
structure of high and low cloud.
