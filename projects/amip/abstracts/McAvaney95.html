<B>McAvaney, B. J.</B> and B. Mullan, 1995: Comparison of model
behaviour in middle and high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere (Diagnostic
Subproject 9). Abstracts of the First International AMIP Scientific Conference,
Monterey, California, 76.

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The semi-annual oscillation in mean sea level pressure and the structure
of the double jet in the Southern Hemisphere have been investigated for
a wide range of AMIP models after consideration of the quality of the simulated
mean climate for middle and high latitudes.

<P>No single model performs well in all above aspects of the circulation
in the Southern Hemisphere with considerable variation on model performance
over different oceanic basins. However the best performing models show
an encouraging level of simulation capability in middle to high Southern
latitudes.

<P>The ability of some AMIP models to simulate the position and strength
of the storm tracks (as defined by the band pass filtered 500 hpa geopotential
variance) in the Southern Hemisphere has also been assessed using daily
model output. Also the relation of the simulated storm tracks to other
eddy statistics is explored.

<P>A few models do surprisingly well at simulating the storm tracks.
