<B>Sperber, K. R. </B>and T. Palmer, 1995: AMIP diagnostic subproject
6: Monsoons and tropical rainfall predictability. Abstracts of the First
International AMIP Scientific Conference, Monterey, California, 65.

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The interannual variability and potential predictability of rainfall
over the Indian subcontinent, the Sahel and the Nordeste region of Brazil
have been evaluated from the suite of AMIP simulations. Variations over
the Nordeste region are most readily captured owing to the intimate link
between the rainfall and the Pacific and Atlantic SSTs. The precipitation
variations over the Indian subcontinent and the Sahel are relatively less
well captured by the models respectively. Additionally, an Indian monsoon
windshear index (akin to that constructed by Webster and Yang, 1992) was
calculated for each model. The models are generally more adept at simulating
the variability of the windshear index than that associated with the rainfall
over this region, indicating that the models exhibit greater fidelity at
capturing the large-scale dynamical fluctuations. For each region improved
skill scores and enhanced potential predictability result for those models
that qualitatively simulate the observed rainfall/SST correlation pattern
which is dominated by an ENSO teleconnection in the Pacific Ocean. Accordingly
for this subset of the models, the enhancement in skill and potential predictability
occurred mainly during years of strong El Ni&ntilde;o or La Ni&ntilde;a
conditions.

<P>A suite of six ECMWF AMIP runs (differing only in their initial conditions)
have also been examined. The Indian monsoon rainfall exhibits a consistent
response during 1987 and 1988, while during other years differences are
simply not very predictable, possibly because of internal chaotic dynamics
that are associated with intraseasonal monsoon fluctuations. In this case
the potential predictability is poor (less than 1) indicating that the
average intramodel spread is greater than the temporal variability of the
ensemble mean. For the Sahel and the Nordeste the potential predictability
increases to 2.4 and 9.0 respectively indicating a robust response to the
boundary conditions for this model.
