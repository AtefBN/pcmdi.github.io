of GCM and MSU temperatures for the AMIP experiment (1979-88) (Diagnostic
Subproject 19). Abstracts of the First International AMIP Scientific Conference,

<BR>Atmospheric thickness anomalies of the 850-200 hPa layer has been found
to be highly correlated (R=0.85-0.95) with the Microwave Sounding Unit
(MSU) channel 2 Tb (brightness temperature) anomalies. Monthly anomalies
of the models' thickness and Tb were correlated by model grid point over
the ten-year study period (N=120). All models demonstrate their highest
degree of correlation in the near equatorial region. All of the models
analyzed at this point have their highest correlation in the Eastern Tropical
Pacific Ocean. All models tested share a common decreasing value of correlation
in the poleward directions.

<P>To show the variation of temperature sensitivity in the models, a global
thickness index was derived. The global mean monthly anomalies of both
850-200 hPa thickness and Tb, were computed and the quotient of the respective
standard deviations: s(Z')/s(Tb') was calculated. It may be thought of
as the global mean thickness change which occurs for a corresponding global
mean change of 1&deg;C in the Tb. The authors have found a clearly wide
range (40-64 gpm) in global mean layer thickness sensitivity to SST forcing
among the models. The corresponding global mean index for 850-200 hPa thickness
calculated by radiosonde versus co-located Tb radiances for 1979-88 is
55 gpm/degrees C. Most models display less sensitivity than is observed,
indicating that the heat supplied from the SST anomalies is not effectively
transported into the tropospheric layer globally.

<P>Thickness variations at every gridpoint were converted to simulated
MSU values by an empirically derived formula. From this a decadal trend
could be calculated, all models demonstrate a strongly positive trend -
values range from +0.08 to +0.23. The MSU2 demonstrates a significantly
lower value of +0.025.

<P>Principal component analysis was performed on the model thicknesses,
and confirms the main atmospheric response pattern, that being associated
with the ENSO. The NH has a relatively good agreement that diminishes in
the extratropics and SH. The first empirical orthogonal function explains
9.8% of the total variance in the MSU, and a corresponding 16.4% of the
variance for the ECMWF thicknesses. SST forcing alone appears to have little
consequence in defining the mid-latitude circulation, as correlations between
observed and model-derived Tb were universally near zero there.

<P>Persistence of anomalies was investigated by calculating the variance
for monthly, seasonal and annual gridded anomalies. A general characteristic
of the models is that the magnitude of variance, relative to MSU variance,
increases as averaging period increases indicating a tendency for anomalies
in models to persist longer than observed.

<P>In order to detect the impact of the El Chich&oacute;n volcanic eruption
of April, 1982, on surface temperature, we have examined the AMIP model
output for the 10-year AMIP period and separated the ENSO and volcanic
signals. We interpolated all model output to a 5 x 5 degree grid, the same
grid as the Jones surface temperature data, and calculated the temperature
anomalies with respect to the 10-year mean. We then selected 9 of the 21
models where the first EOF had a correlation greater than 0.71 with the
SOI index. They were: CCC, CNRM, CSU, ECMWF, GLA, GSFC, JMA, MPI and UCLA.

<P>We then compared the patterns produced by these models with the patterns
for the winters of 82-83 and 86-87. While all the models simulated the
86-87 winter well, for 82-83, the difference between the model output and
the observations shows a clear winter warming pattern from volcanic eruptions.
