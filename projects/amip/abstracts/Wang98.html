<br><font face="TIMES">General circulation models (GCMs) have been used
extensively to study global climate change and its regional distribution
due to increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and sulfate
aerosols associated with human activities. One important issue related
to the continued development and application of GCMs for climate change
studies is the ability for GCMs to simulate observed regional climate characteristics.
An understanding of the causes for models’ inadequacy in simulating these
characteristics will lead to their further improvement.</font>
<p><font face="TIMES">East Asia is located in the southeastern part of
the Eurasian continent. It is bordered in the east by the Pacific Ocean,
and in the southwest by the Tibetan Plateau which penetrates into the middle
troposphere. These unique geographic features produce distinct climate
characteristics over East Asia. Observational analyses indicate that this
region has the strongest heat sources/sinks in the Northern Hemisphere,
and that the Tibetan Plateau creates vigorous dynamic and thermal forcing.
Both factors induce substantial atmospheric responses that result in well-defined,
seasonally varying general circulation features. In winter, the primary
features are the lower-tropospheric continental high, the upper-tropospheric
East Asia westerly jet, the East Asia trough and the stratospheric Aleutian
high. In summer, the dominant features include the lower-tropospheric continental
heat low and the upper tropospheric/lower stratospheric Tibetan high.</font>
<p><font face="TIMES">These stationary circulation systems produce several
unique regional climate characteristics over East Asia, including (1) the
mid-tropospheric Zonal Index Cycle (ZIC) which describes the vacillation
between "high (zonal) index" and "low (meridional) index" circulation patterns;
(2) Seasonal Abrupt Changes (SACs) in June and October caused by non-linear
atmospheric responses to large-scale external forcing, such as seasonal
variations in solar insolation, and the dynamic and thermal effects of
the Tibetan Plateau; and (3) the East Asia Monsoon (EAM) characterized
by heavy precipitation in summer and cold surges during winter. Note that
ZIC, SAC and EAM are not independent features. For instance, the onset
of the summer and winter EAM is closely associated with SAC. In addition,
rainfall identified with the prevailing zonal circulation patterns is caused
by processes that differ substantially from those related to extratropical
cyclones and tropical deep convection. The summer EAM rainband is typically
a quasi-stationary large-scale feature that produces continuous precipitation.
Embedded within the rainband are mesoscale vortices, which produce intense
local rainfall. It is well known that these EAC characteristics experience
substantial intraseasonal and interannual variability.</font>
<p><font face="TIMES">To study the capability of GCMs to simulate the climate
over East Asia, an international research program entitled, "General Circulation
Model Simulations of the East Asia Climate (EAC)" was initiated in the
Fall of 1994 within the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP).
The program’s objectives are to assess the ability of current GCMs to simulate
the EAC and to study the mechanisms and geophysical factors that cause
the intraseasonal to interannual variability. A GCM-to-observation comparison
was conducted to examine the climatological mean and variability of individual
climate parameters (e.g., sea level pressure, surface temperature, wind,
precipitation, outgoing longwave radiation, 500 mb height, snow/ice cover)
and their mutual associations. These findings will subsequently be used
to design sensitivity experiments to identify the mechanisms important
to the EAC. Here, we report some results focusing on the seasonal variation
of precipitation.</font>
