Model CCCMA: Elaborations&nbsp;
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h1>

<font size=+0>Model CCCMA is an entry in both the CMIP1 and CMIP2 intercomparison
experiments.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="Spinup/Initialization"></a>Spinup/Initialization</h3>
The procedure for spinup/initialization of the CCCma coupled model is as
follows (reference: G. Boer and G. Flato, personal communication):
<ul>
<li>
The model atmosphere was integrated to equilibrium with a mixed-layer ocean
and sea ice. Monthly climatological surface fluxes were obtained.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The model ocean was spun up for > 4000 years from an initial state of rest
with uniform temperature and salinity. The ocean was forced with monthly
mean atmospheric model surface stresses and with relaxation to monthly
mean <a href="#Alexander and Mobley 1976">Alexander-Mobley (1976)</a> surface
temperatures and <a href="#Levitus 1982">Levitus (1982)</a> salinities,
where the relaxation time scale was 30 days. Climatological monthly mean
surface fluxes were obtained.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Flux adjustments for heat and fresh water were calculated from the uncoupled
equilibria of the atmospheric and ocean models. An adaptive coupled simulation
with these flux adjustments and relaxation terms with 60-day time scales
was carried out for a period of 14 years, and a refined flux adjustment
was obtained. Finally, the fresh-water flux adjustments were further modified
based on residual model drift during an additional coupled simulation of
5 years.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The models were coupled and run for an additional 20 years with the refined
flux adjustments imposed prior to the beginning of the experiment, whose
nominal start time was the year 1850. The coupled model then was integrated
for 200 years, exhibiting a residual drift of ~ 0.1 deg C per century.
In order to be well-separated from the initial state, data retained from
nominal years 1900 to 2150 was provided for CMIP.</li>
</ul>

<a NAME="Land Surface Processes"></a>Land Surface Processes</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Soil heat storage is determined as a residual of the surface heat fluxes
and of the heat source/sink of freezing/melting snow cover and soil ice
(see below). Soil temperature is computed from this heat storage in a single
layer, following the method of <a href="#Deardorff(1978">Deardorff (1978)</a>
which accounts for both diurnal and longer-period forcing. The composite
conductivity/heat capacity of the soil in each grid box is computed as
a function of soil type, soil moisture, and snow cover.</li>
</ul>

<ul><font size=+0>Soil moisture is predicted by a single-layer "bucket"
model with field capacity and slope factors varying by primary/secondary
soil and vegetation types for each grid box. Soil moisture budgets include
both liquid and frozen water. The effective local moisture capacity is
given by the product of field capacity and slope factor, with evapotranspiration
efficiency beta a function of the ratio of soil moisture to the local effective
moisture capacity. Runoff occurs implicitly if this ratio exceeds 1 (which
is more likely the higher the local slope factor and the lower the local
field capacity). Runoff from GCM squares within a river basin is transported
directly to the ocean grid square at the mouth of the river. Cf. <a href="#McFarlane et al.(1992)">McFarlane
et al. (1992)</a>, <a href="#Boer et al.(1984a)">Boer et al. (1984)</a>
, and <a href="#Flato et al. 1998">Flato et al. (1998)</a> for further
details.</font></ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Sea Ice"></a>Sea Ice</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Sea ice forms when the temperature of the ocean mixed layer is less than
the freezing point of salt water (approximately 271.18 K).&nbsp; Until
the ice mass exceeds a threshold of 45 kg m<sup>-2</sup>,<sup> </sup>however,the
ocean surface is not considered to be ice-covered.&nbsp; Leads are represented
as thin-ice regions, with mass equal to this threshold value.&nbsp; The
fractional area of leads decreases as the total ice mass increases.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Snow may accumulate on sea ice.&nbsp; Snow that falls on thin ice, or on
ice&nbsp;<sup> </sup>whose mass&nbsp; is less than 45 kg m<sup>-2</sup>,
is assumed to directly augment the ice.&nbsp; The average density of snow
on the ice is 275 kg m<sup>-3</sup>; this increases exponentially with
depth (at an e-folding value of 1.85 m).&nbsp; To prevent the density profile
of snow from exceeding that of the ice, the snow mass is limited to1180
kg m<sup>-2</sup>, with any excess being converted to ice.&nbsp; Snow also
affects the surface albedo.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Sea ice thermodynamics follow <a href="#Semtner 1976">Semtner (1976)</a>.&nbsp;
The surface temperature of the ice is a prognostic function of the surface
heat balance and of a conduction heat flux from the underlying ocean. The
conduction flux, which depends on the ice thickness and the temperature
gradient between the ocean and the ice, is specified to restore ice amounts/extents
to climatological values.&nbsp; In order to prevent unbounded growth of
ice, negative heat flux and temperature adjustments are disallowed if the
ice thickness exceeds 2 m.&nbsp; In the Southern ocean, a heat flux of
at least 14 W m<sup>-2</sup> is extracted from the ocean to prevent continuous
accumulation of ice when temperatures are too cold to allow summer melt.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Sea ice dynamics and rheology are neglected.&nbsp; For further information
