            Peter Caldwell is a staff scientist in and deputy group leader for the Cloud Process Research (CPR) group at
            the
            Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (DOE LLNL) in Livermore, California. His
            research
            is broadly focused on clouds and their role in climate change with special interest in stratocumulus, cloud
            feedback, high-resolution global climate model development and evaluation, regional climate modeling,
            numerics
            of climate models, and statistical analysis of climate model ensembles. Peter was recently a co-leader for
            atmospheric and coupled model development for DOE's $18M/yr Accelerated Climate Model for Energy (ACME)
            project.
            He is currently leading a team focused on numerics of parameterizations for DOE's Scientific Discovery
            through
            Advanced Computing (SciDAC) and Climate Model Development and Validation (CMDV) projects.

            Peter came to LLNL in 2007 as a postdoc working on regional climate modeling. Before that, he worked on his
            PhD
            at the University of Washington (UW) under the tutelage of Christopher S. Bretherton. While at UW, Peter
            used
            observations and simple models to understand the physical processes underlying stratocumulus response to a
            changing climate. Peter's original background is in math and much of his current research spans the
            boundaries
            between climate science, numerical analysis, statistics, and computer science.
