## 1. Experiment design

The CMIP6 protocol and experiments are described in a [special issue][GMDSpecialIssue] of Geoscientific Model Development with an overview of the design and scientific strategy provided in the lead article of that issue by [Eyring et al. (2016)][EyringEtAl16]

Each model participating in CMIP6 will contribute results from the four DECK experiments (piControl, AMIP, abrupt4xCO2, and 1pctCO2) and the CMIP6 historical simulation. These experiments are the only ones  directly overseen by the the [CMIP Panel][CMIPPanel], and together these constitute the ongoing (slowly evolving) “CMIP Activity”.  They are described in [Eyring et al. (2016)][EyringEtAl16]

In addition to the DECK and historical simulations, each modeling group may choose to contribute to any of the [CMIP6 endorsed MIPs][CMIP6EndorsedMips].  See the [GMD Special CMIP6 Issue][GMDSpecialIssue] for descriptions of each MIP and its experiment specifications. The official names of the currently endorsed CMIP6 MIP activities are recorded in a [“json” file][activityIdJson].

When called for by the experiment protocol, [standard forcing data sets](input4mips) have been used. Any deviation from the standard forcing are supposed to be clearly [documented](#5-model-and-experiment-documentation).

Further documentation about CMIP6 experiments will be available from [ES-DOC][es-docsCmip6], and the reference controlled vocabularies used to define and identify these experiments are available in a [“json” file][experimentIdJson] and are also rendered in [table form][experimentIdhtml].
