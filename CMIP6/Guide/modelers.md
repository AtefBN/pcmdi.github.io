## Requirements and expectations
Those groups who plan to participate in CMIP6 should (in roughly this order, although model documentation should be provided as early as possible):

* Indicate your intention to participate by registering your institution and model following the instructions on the [WCRP-CMIP github site][wcrpGithubSite].
 ***You will not be able to publish your model output (on ESGF) without first registering your institution and model.***
 (To do this, anyone without a github account will have to create one). The currently registered institutions are listed in a [“json” file][jsonFile]
 and can be displayed in [table form][tableForm], and so are the currently registered models: [“json” file][jsonFile] and [table][tableForm].

* Register contact information for person(s) responsible for entering and maintaining CMIP6 model output citation information in the citation GUI (Documentation of GUI).  This information will be used by web-based services being developed and maintained at DKRZ to ensure that data produced by your center is properly cited.   Data users will be able to access citation information following the URL stored as a global attribute (further_info_url) in each of your netCDF files and also following links to each dataset displayed by the ESGF search service.

* Provide the following to Martina Stockhause (stockhause@dkrz.de) so that an account can be set up:
Person: name, email, ORCID (if available), affiliation and
Specification of the data, for which this person is responsible, using the source_id and institution_id that you have registered at the WCRP-CMIP github site (see first bullet above).

* If you are not yet included in the CMIP6-MODELGROUPS-SCI mail list, register your scientific contact with CMIP Panel Chair, Veronika Eyring (veronika.eyring@dlr.de).

* Indicate your intention to participate in “endorsed MIPs” by signing up for the endorsed-MIP mailing lists of interest (click on each MIP of interest in the list) and also registering the information in the activity_participation field of your source_id (see first bullet above).

* Perform required DECK, historical, and selected endorsed-MIP experiments, using the required, standard forcing datasets:

* Save all requested model output.

* Provide all required model documentation.

* Prepare and make available model output according to CMIP6 specifications (see sections 5, 6, and 7 below).

* Correct published data when errors are discovered... [information forthcoming - this will be linked to ES-DOCS errata services].
