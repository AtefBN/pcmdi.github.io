# A Guide to CMIP6 Participation
#### Karl E. Taylor, Sebastien Denvil, Paul J. Durack, Michael Lautenschlager, Martina Stockhause, Dean Williams and many others

This guide is a “living” document, which will be augmented and updated as needed. It is sub-divided into three parts distinguished by the groups served:

1. [Modelers][modelers] carrying out CMIP6 simulations,
2. [Data managers][dataManagers] responsible for data node operations, and
3. [Data users][users] analyzing and making use of CMIP6 model output.

Here are links to the parts of the guide.


### [For CMIP6 participating climate modelers][modelers]:

1. Requirements/expectations
2. Experiment design
3. Forcing data sets
4. Model output fields
5. Model output requirements
6. Software for preparing/checking output
7. Archiving/publishing output
8. Documentation process
9. CMIP6 organization and governance


### [For CMIP6 ESGF data node managers and operators][dataManagers] (in preparation):

1. Hardware requirements
2. Operational requirements/expectations
3. Publication procedure
4. Software supporting publication/replication


### [For Users of CMIP6 model output][users] (in preparation):

1. Experiment design
2. Model output specifications
3. Accessing model output
