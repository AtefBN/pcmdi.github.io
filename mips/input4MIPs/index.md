# input4MIPs
input4MIPS (input datasets for Model Intercomparison Projects) is an activity
to make available via ESGF the boundary condition and forcing datasets needed
for CMIP6. Various datasets are needed for the pre-industrial control (piControl),
AMIP, and historical simulations, and additional datasets are needed for
many of the [CMIP6-endorsed model intercomparison projects (MIPs) experiments][CMIP6EndorsedMIPs].

Earlier versions of many of these datasets were used in the [5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)][CMIP5].
