<BR>Simulations of Water and Energy Budgets (Diagnostic Subproject 17)
Simulations from one of the AMIP global models (GENESIS) and a regional-scale
model are compared and contrasted with respect to the ensemble effects
of subsynoptic moisture and heat transports, cloud and radiative effects,
and precipitation on the energy and water cycles. The comparison region
is essentially the Mississippi Basin. GENESIS does not prognose cloud and
rain water explicitly, instead it diagnoses these parameters. On the other
hand, the regional-scale numerical model includes explicit predictive equations
for cloud and rain water. To compare and contrast the water and energy
budgets resulting from the GENESIS diagnostic procedures with the budgets
from the regional-scale model prognostic procedures, long-term (greater
than 10 days) simulations were performed.

<P>The limiting errors in budget calculations performed using GENESIS versus
the regional-scale model are evaluated and the sensitivity of the modeled
regional energy and water balance to model grid scale and physics is evaluated.
