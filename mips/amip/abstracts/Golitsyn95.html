<BR>The Caspian Sea and adjacent regions received an increased attention
from geophysical science due to their unique natural characteristics. Being
a closed basin with no surface outlets, the Caspian Sea shows high sensitivity
to climatic variations. Its level depends on the balance between precipitation
and evaporation over a large area including the sea and its watersheds.
It effectively filters high frequency variations of net water balance and
serves as a good indicator of long-term climatic trends through observed
changes of its water level.

<P>The AMIP programme presents a unique opportunity to assess the ability
of the current GCMs to simulate the water cycle and heat balance of the
atmosphere for the Caspian Sea region. An analysis of precipitation, evaporation,
runoff, snow mass, radiation balance, surface temperature etc. was conducted
for most of the models participating in the 10-years integrations with
prescribed SST for the period 1979-1988. The models employ a large range
of spatial resolutions and incorporate different parameterizations of physical
processes. Regional analysis is made separately for models having low and
high resolutions.

<P>The computed seasonal cycle of precipitation over the Caspian Sea and
its watershed show large spread for the low resolution as compared to that
of the high resolution models. In about half of the models the annual precipitation
is underestimated over the watershed and the maximum of the summer precipitation
occurs 1-2 months later as compared to the observation. The seasonal cycle
of the surface temperature is well simulated with high resolution models.
The maximum snow mass accumulated over the watershed in winter has a large
range of variations. Because integration in some models started from initial
conditions with large snow mass, it took about one year to attain an equilibrium
for the main heat and water balance components in such models.

<P>Most of the high resolution models indicate the existence of a signal
in precipitation over the watershed that decreased in 1983; this relationship
is also found in the index of drought. The annual sea level derived from
the net water balance over the Caspian Sea and its watershed increases
during 1979-1988 in the majority of the models. However the sea level trend
varies significantly.

<P>The annual precipitation over watersheds of the Volga and Ural rivers
and evaporation from the Caspian Sea provide the main contribution to the
sea level change. The correct size of the Caspian sea presented in the
models is crucial for the calculation of the water balance and this depends
on the horizontal resolution. This implies that the net water balance may
vary significantly among the models even if the net annual runoff is the
same. For this reason, preference was made in the analysis to models having
a realistic size to the Caspian Sea. The high resolution models usually
satisfy such conditions.
