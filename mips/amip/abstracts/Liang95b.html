<B>Liang, X.-Z.,</B> K. Sperber, W.-C. Wang and A. Samel, 1995:
Predictability of SST forced climate signals in two atmospheric general
circulation models. Monthly Weather Review (submitted).&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">The predictability of atmospheric responses to global
sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies is evaluated using ensemble simulations
of two general circulation models (GCMs): the GENESIS version 1.5 (GEN)
and the ECMWF cycle 36 (ECM). The integrations incorporate observed SST
variations but start from different initial land and atmospheric states.
Five GEN 1980-1992 and six ECM 1980-1988 realizations are compared with
observations to distinguish predictable SST forced climate signals from
internal variability. To facilitate the study, correlation analysis and
significance evaluation techniques are developed on the basis of time series
permutations.

<P>It is found that the annual mean global area with realistic signals
is variable dependent and ranges from 3 to 20% in GEN and 6 to 28% in ECM.
Due to the existence of model biases, robust responses, which are independent
of initial conditions, occur over broader areas. Both GCMs demonstrate
that the sensitivity to initial conditions increases and the predictability
of SST forced responses decreases from 500 hPa height, sea-level pressure,
200 hPa zonal wind, outgoing longwave radiation to 850 hPa zonal wind.
The predictable signals are concentrated in the tropical and subtropical
Pacific Ocean and are identified with typical E1 Nino/Southern Oscillation
phenomena that occur in response to SST and diabatic heating anomalies
over the equatorial central Pacific. ECM is less sensitive to initial conditions
and better predicts SST forced climate changes. This is because ECM has
a more realistic basic climatology, especially of the wind circulation,
and a more vigorous hydrologic cycle.

<P>Differences between the models and observations are identified. For
GEN during E1 Nino, the convection does not carry the energy to a sufficiently
high altitude, while the spread of the tropospheric warming along the equator
is slower and the anomaly magnitude smaller than observed. This impacts
model ability to simulate realistic responses over Eurasia and the Indian
Ocean. Similar biases exist in the ECM response. In addition, the relationships
between upper and lower tropospheric wind responses to SST forcing are
not well reproduced by either model.
