<B>Le Treut, H.,</B> Z. Li, O. Boucher, G. Seze and M. Doutriaux,
1995: Some aspects of the LMD GCM verification and development: clouds
and radiative budget. Abstracts of the First International AMIP Scientific
Conference, Monterey, California, 103.&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">The objective of the talk is to document the evolution
of the LMD GCM in terms of cloud and radiation, starting from the official
AMIP experiment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>The parameterization of clouds in the LMD GCM has evolved continuously,
in order to improve the model climatology, but also following the need
to take into account new concerns and new physical processes. One example
is the need to better understand the indirect effects of aerosols in climate
change scenarios. An important development of the model parameterizations
has therefore been to introduce a representation of the cloud microphysics
which affects the cloud precipitation. The treatment of convective clouds
and convective cloud water has also been the subject of various studies.
These modifications have been documented by the comparison to various data
sets: ERBE radiative budgets, but also ISCCP analysis, or ground-based
cloud observations. The methodological aspects of these comparisons, and
the importance of cloud subgrid-scale properties will be reviewed. Finally
the results of the more recent higher-resolution versions of the model
will also be described.
