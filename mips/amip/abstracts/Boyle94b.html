<BR>Divergence and convergence centers at 200 hPa and mean sea level pressure
(MSLP) cyclones are located every 6 hours for a 10-year GCM simulation
for the boreal winters from 1980 to 1988. The simulation used the observed
monthly mean SST for the decade. Analysis of the frequency, locations,
and strengths of these centers and cyclones give insight into the dynamical
response of the model to the varying SST. It is found that 1) the model
produced reasonable climatologies of upper-level divergence and MSLP cyclones.
2) The model distribution of anomalies of divergence/convergence centers
and MSLP cyclones is consistent with available observations for the 1982-83
and 1986-87 El Ni&ntilde;o events. 3) The tropical Indian Ocean is the
region of greatest divergence activity and interannual variability in the
model. 4) The variability of the divergence centers is greater than that
of the convergence centers. 5) Strong divergence centers are chiefly oceanic
events in the midlatitudes but are more land based in the tropics, except
in the Indian Ocean. 6) Locations of divergence/convergence centers can
be a useful tool for the intercomparison of global atmospheric simulations.
