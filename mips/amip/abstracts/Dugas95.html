<B>Dugas, B.,</B> G. Brunet and H. Ritchie, 1995: Progress on AMIP
integrations with the RPN spectral forecast model. Abstracts of the First
International AMIP Scientific Conference, Monterey, California, 105.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">A follow-up to the first RPN AMIP integration is reported
upon. The new simulations utilise higher spatial resolutions both in the
vertical and in the horizontal. Furthermore, several modifications to the
physical parametrizations have been implemented in order to correct for
deficiencies identified in the first run. We compare a control (using a
repeating but specified seasonal cycle of sea surface temperature and sea
ice coverage) with the standard AMIP-type simulation (i.e. which uses varying
monthly mean values of these fields for the 1979-1988 decade). We also
compare our results with NMC analyses for the simulated decade.

<P>The RPN AMIP integrations are done with a version of the Canadian global
spectral forecast model, a state-of-the-art forecast engine. The model
uses a semi-implicit, semi-Lagrangian time integration scheme which allows
for very efficient use of existing computer resources. These runs are used
by RPN to better understand and correct for our model's systematic errors.
