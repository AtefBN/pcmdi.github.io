and potential predictability (Diagnostic Subproject 2). Abstracts of the
First International AMIP Scientific Conference, Monterey, California, 81.

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The interannual variabilities of seasonal means of geopotential simulated
by a number of models participating in AMIP are intercompared amongst themselves
and against the observed variability. One-way analysis of variance techniques
are applied to ascertain the extent to which this variability is potentially
predictable.
