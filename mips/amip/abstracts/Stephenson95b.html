<BR>The Southern Oscillation (SO) is examined in three 10 year AMIP-type
integrations of a 30-level GCM having prescribed monthly mean observed
sea surface temperatures for the period January 1979 to December 1988.
Three horizontal spectral resolutions of T21, T42 and T79 are investigated
and the results are compared with the low-frequency variability, having
periods longer than 8 months, in the observed Darwin and Tahiti sea level
pressures (SLP) and in the T106 ECMWF analyses from May 1985 to April 1991.
Both the ECMWF analyses and the GCM results give unrealistic SLP variability
at Tahiti resulting in low Darwin-Tahiti SLP correlations and low S/N ratios
for the Tahiti-Darwin SO index. The ECMWF analyses are in particularly
poor agreement with the observations during 1987 with anomalously high
SLP at Tahiti. Examination of the ECMWF assimilated SSTs, reveals that
this may be related to the assimilated SSTs being too cold in the central
and eastern equatorial Pacific during mid-1987. The GCM results show the
familiar SLP dipole in the tropical Pacific albeit displaced eastwards
compared to previous observational studies especially at T42 resolution,
thus accounting for the problems at Tahiti which lies near strong gradients
in the correlation pattern. Time-longitude diagrams of low-level convergence
and correlation maps of upper level streamfunction suggest that the model
is reproducing the SO divergence anomalies although too weakly at T21 resolution
and at different longitudinal locations at T42 and T79 resolutions. The
time-mean low-level convergences in the GCM simulations give ITCZs and
SPCZs in qualitative agreement with the observations with a tendency for
increased convergence in the eastern Pacific ITCZ at higher resolution.
Longitudinal shifts are not apparent in the time-mean convergence when
comparing the GCM results at different resolutions.
