<LI>
Our participation in the AMIP exercise yielded a 10 year 1979-1988 integration
with the 17-layer GLA GCM which&nbsp; in turn was derived from the earlier
9-layer version of the GLA GCM of Kalnay et al. (1983), but for several&nbsp;
improvements on an ongoing basis. We discovered the following key features
of the model.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The model simulates a very stable rainfall climatology and surface hydrology
that is characterized by realistic&nbsp; interannual variations in response
to observationally prescribed sea-surface temperatures.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The model also simulates a statistically discernible climate variation
in the tropics together with a realistic large-scale&nbsp; response of
the monsoon circulation forced by the 1987/1988 SST variations.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
Among the key outstanding features of the simulation are i) a respectable
Koeppen Climate classification, ii) a realistic 30-60 day oscillation,
1995: and iii) a skillful response of the Indian and Asian monsoons to
SSTs and presumably snow and ice. The key model deficiencies comprise the
following:</LI>
</OL>

<UL>a. Too high land surface temperature particularly in the local summer
season.

<P>b. Excessive zonality of circulation at mid and high latitudes with
weak eddy transports and low polar surface pressures.

<P>c. Lack of skill in seasonal forecasts outside the tropics.

<P>d. Several isolated generic deficiencies of all GCMs.</UL>
Our presentation will include major hydrologic outputs of our model higlighting
the successes and failures of the simulation. Based on the above realizations
and in preparation for second phase of AMIP, we have included cumulus downdrafts
and gravity-wave drag into the GCM.
