GCM. Abstracts of the First International AMIP Scientific Conference, Monterey,

<BR>The major interest of research in the Goddard Institute for Space Studies
(GISS) is long term climate change. One of the tools to study this change
is through the use of GCMs. Therefore a great deal of effort has been spent
at GISS to improve its GCM. In order to evaluate how well the new dynamics
and physical parameterization schemes work, we need to compare GCM results
with observations. GCM runs using the AMIP SST as forcing are convenient
ways to evaluate the performance of the new schemes. A 10-year GCM run
not only can help us to evaluate how well the GCM behaves in the mean state,
but can also tell us how well the GCM captures intra- and inter-annual
variabilities.

<P>This study involves comparing the results of the GISS Model II GCM and
the GCM results submitted to AMIP. The GCM result submitted to AMIP is
from one of the intermediate versions of the new GISS GCM, which is still
under development. This version has a quadratic upstream scheme for the
advection of temperature and humidity, 8th order Shapiro filter, new physical
parameterization schemes of convection, large scale clouds, planetary boundary
layer and ground hydrology. The radiation has dust and anthropogenic aerosol
included. Global mean states, intra- and inter-annual variabilities of
the model results are studied. The meteorological parameters studied include
surface air temperature, precipitation, evaporation, surface winds, 500
hPa height, 850 hPa zonal wind, outgoing long wave radiation and incident
solar radiation at the Earth's surface.

<P>The global mean states of both the old model and the new model agree
with the observational values. This is particularly gratifying because
many of the new schemes are based on physical principles and rely less
on tuning. Geographical distributions of precipitation, outgoing long wave
radiation, incident solar radiation and surface winds show significant
improvement of the new model from the old. The surface air temperature
and evaporation also show acceptable results except over mountains and
arid areas. Seasonal variability of the zonal mean of different parameters
indicates considerable improvement in the seasonal distribution of water
vapor and cloud, and the movement of the ITCZ. For interannual variability,
Hovm&ouml;ller diagrams of OLR anomaly, 850 hPa zonal wind anomaly and
precipitation anomaly show that the new model captures the 1983 and 1987
El Ni&ntilde;o events very well while the old model fails to show strong
signals for the two El Ni&ntilde;os.

<P>Tentatively, we conclude that the new convection, large-scale cloud
and planetary boundary layer parameterization schemes show noteworthy improvement.
The effects of the other new schemes require more tests.
