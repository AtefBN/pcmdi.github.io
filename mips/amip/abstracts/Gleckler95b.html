<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>This paper summarizes the ocean surface net energy flux simulated by
fifteen atmospheric general circulation models constrained by realistically-varying
sea surface temperatures and sea ice as part of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison
Project. In general, the simulated energy fluxes are within the very large
observational uncertainties. However, the annual mean oceanic meridional
heat transport that would be required to balance the simulated surface
fluxes is shown to be critically sensitive to the radiative effects of
clouds, to the extent that even the sign of the Southern Hemisphere ocean
heat transport can be affected by the errors in simulated cloud-radiation
interactions. It is suggested that improved treatment of cloud radiative
effects should help in the development of coupled atmosphere-ocean general
circulation models.
