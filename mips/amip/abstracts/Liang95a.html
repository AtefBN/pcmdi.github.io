<BR>Systematic biases in the SUNYA/NCAR (T31L18) AMIP experiment are analyzed
by comparing simulated and observed 1980-88 climatological means. Experiments
with R15 resolution are also conducted to examine the sensitivity of these
biases to horizontal resolution and to cloud radiative treatment. To facilitate
the analyses, the model bias is decomposed into zonal mean and eddy components
of the annual average and its monthly variation. Note that, when averaged
over a whole year and all the longitudes at a latitudinal band, the total
(squared) biases equal to the sum of the four (squared) components.

<P>The surface pressure bias is found to be large, dominated by the eddies
of the annual average. Annual average and monthly variation of precipitation
is generally realistic in the zonal mean, but large regional errors are
identified especially in the tropics. Biases in the 200 hPa zonal wind
show three peaks at 60&deg;S, 30&deg;S and the equator, and indicate a
systematic northward shift of the jet with biases predominantly in the
annual average. Substantial reductions in these biases occur when the resolution
increases from R15 to T31. Similarly, 500 hPa height errors in the Southern
Hemisphere extratropics can be attributed primarily to the annual average
and these biases are also substantially reduced as resolution increases.
When compared with ECMWF analysis data, a cold upper troposphere throughout
the year, especially at high latitudes, exists in both resolutions. The
cloud cover in T31 is about half of observations with consequent large
biases in cloud radiative forcing. These are caused mainly by the errors
in the annual average, which can largely be corrected by using a lower
relative humidity threshold for cloud formation. Despite the fact that
the global mean cloud cover is close to observations in R15, daily variability
in the 200 hPa zonal wind is largely overestimated in the tropics, but
it is more realistically simulated in T31. In addition, over most of the
Northern Hemisphere extratropics, 500 hPa height meridional gradient biases
reverse sign between R15 and T31 during winter. These results indicate
that the relative importance of dynamic versus cloud-radiative forcing
errors cannot be clearly identified. This is also evident from another
R15 simulation with different cloud radiative treatment. Although the improved
cloud radiative scheme produces more realistic seasonal variations in cloud
cover and cloud radiative forcing, impacts on the geographic distribution
of 200 hPa zonal wind, 500 hPa height, surface air temperature and precipitation
are found to be relatively small.
