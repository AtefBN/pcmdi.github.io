<B>Barnett, T. P.</B> 1995b: The AMIP: A stochastic experience.
Abstracts of the First International AMIP Scientific Conference, Monterey,
California, 72.&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>A mini-AMIP has been conducted to examine the deterministic vs. stochastic
behavior of one AGCM. It was carried out as follows:

<P>Ensemble forecasts of global climate conditions during the seven largest
Pacific warm/cold events of the last 23 years were made with a new two-tiered
climate forecast technique. The internal model variability (IMV) within
the atmospheric model used in the forecasts was large-approximately 1/3
to 1/2 the variability obtained from the same model forced by observed
SST over the last 20 years (AMIP). This variability led to a wide range
of realistic-looking forecasts even when the equatorial SST forcing was
nil. For example, single model forecasts forced by climatological SST produced
excellent simulations of the extreme cold event of 1988/89 and the large
warm event of 1982/83. Clearly, single simulations are inadequate for forecasting
and sensitivity studies such as AMIP. The ten member ensembles used in
this study appear a minimum for reliable forecasts/sensitivity studies
in midlatitudes, although fewer realizations may be needed in the tropics.
The next AMIP should be viewed as a stochastic experiment, one requiring
a Monte Carlo framework in order to produce robust results.
