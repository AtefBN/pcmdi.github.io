<BR>Interannual variability simulated by a T21L20 version of the CCSR/NIES
AGCM with 1979-88 SSTs is compared with observed circulation patterns.
The overall magnitude of interannual variance in the troposphere is comparable,
but somewhat smaller than, the observations. Grid-pointwise temporal correlations
between simulated and observed seasonal-mean anomalies of zonal wind at
850hPa reach 0.8 in the eastern equatorial Pacific, but the correlation
drops to insignificant values outside the tropical Pacific. The high correlation
comes from large circulation changes associated with ENSO cycle. Equatorial
low-level westerlies in the 1982/83 and 86/87 warm events and easterlies
during the 1988 cold event are reasonably reproduced. However, even during
these extreme phases of ENSO cycle, correspondence in circulation anomalies
outside the equatorial belt in the Pacific is not particularly impressive.
It appears important to simulate accurately the spatial distribution of
precipitation anomalies not only in the immediate neighborhood of the largest
SST anomalies but also in some key regions such as the western Pacific
and Indian monsoon regions. Outside the tropics, little evidence of correspondence
has been found between the simulated and observed circulation patterns
except for dominance of westerlies over the North Pacific during the warm
events. We would like to investigate the sensitivity of simulated variability
in the tropics to model physics and to horizontal resolution, in tandem
with an attempt to clarify the extent to which SST governs such variations.
