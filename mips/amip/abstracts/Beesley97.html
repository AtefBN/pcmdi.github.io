1997: Toward an explanation of the annual cycle of cloudiness over the
Arctic ocean, <I>Journal of Climate</I> (submitted).

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The annual cycle of low cloud amount over the Arctic Ocean is studied
using climatological data and a time-dependent atmospheric column model.
Three hypotheses for the annual cycle are formulated, compared with climatological
data for consistency, and tested using the model. The hypotheses distinguish
three factors that might account for the annual cycle of cloud amount over
the Arctic Ocean: (1) the annual cycle of water vapor advection into the
Arctic, (2) the annual cycle of evaporation at the surface of the ice pack,
and (3) the effect of the annual cycle of temperature on the formation
and precipitation of atmospheric ice. None of the hypotheses can be ruled
out by inspection of available climatological data, although the transition
between the winter and summer cloudiness regimes appears to occur one month
before the influx of atmospheric moisture increases from its wintertime
level, which weakens the first hypothesis.

<P>The atmospheric column model represents physical processes necessary
to simulate low stratiform clouds observed at lower latitudes, plus ice
phase physical processes that are likely to be important in the Arctic.
The prescribed boundary conditions consist of incoming solar radiation
at the top of the atmosphere; vertical profiles of divergence, temperature
advection, and moisture advection; and open water fraction and ice thickness
at the surface. When forced by standard boundary conditions corresponding
to winter and summer, the model simulates the qualitative regimes of the
respective seasons: large mean cloud amount in summer and small mean cloud
amount in winter. Two sensitivity experiments are performed in which the
standard winter experiment is re-run with summertime values of moisture
advection, and intensity of ice-phase physical processes, respectively.
Only the suppression of ice-phase physical processes produces a significant
increase in the simulated amount of winter low cloudiness. Three sensitivity
experiments are performed in which the standard summer experiment is re-run
with wintertime values of moisture advection, evaporation and ice-phase
physical processes. Only the enhancement of ice-phase processes produces
a significant reduction in the simulated summer cloudiness. These results
suggest that the temperature-dependence of ice phase precipitation processes
is an essential element of the explanation for the annual cycle of low
cloudiness. These processes limit the duration of clouds in winter by converting
atmospheric moisture from liquid cloud particles to larger, rapidly-precipitating
ice particles, and by preventing the mixing ratio in clear air from reaching
saturation with respect to liquid.

<P>It is shown that, among general circulation models participating in
the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project, those that represent ice-phase
precipitation processes produce qualitatively more realistic simulations
of the mean annual cycle of cloud amount over the Arctic Ocean than models
that omit these processes. It is predicted that under a general warming
of Arctic climate, the cloudy summer season would lengthen and vice versa
under a general cooling.
