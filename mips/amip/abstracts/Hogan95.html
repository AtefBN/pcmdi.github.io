<BR>Identifying the differences between the observed and modeled Koeppen
climate classification is an excellent tool in determining both the systematic
errors in general circulations models' rainfall patterns and the improvements
due to changes in physical parameterizations. Several 10 year integrations
have been performed and the Koeppen climates computed with the Navy Operational
Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) with different planetary
boundary layer, surface parameterizations and upper air vertical diffusion
schemes. When compared with the Louis scheme, the Troen and Mahrt planetary
boundary layer formulation substantially reduces the ocean regions where
the rainfall is deficient and slightly improves the land precipitation.
Inclusion of an advanced surface vegetation atmospheric transfer scheme
further improves the overall climate of NOGAPS. However, multi-year runs
with different formulations of mixing above the planetary layer height
also show large differences in the rainfall distribution. It is believed
a better understanding and modeling of the momentum and heat mixing above
the PBL is needed in the models before truly accurate climate modeling
is to be achieved.
