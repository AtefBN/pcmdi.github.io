<HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="100%">Simulations of humidity from 28 general circulation
models for the period 1979-88 from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison
Project are compared with observations from radiosondes over North America
and the globe and with satellite microwave observations over the Pacific
basin. The simulations of decadal mean values of precipitable water (W)
integrated over each of these regions tend to be less moist than the real
atmosphere in all three cases; the median model values are approximately
5% less than the observed values. The spread among the simulations is larger
over regions of high terrain, which suggests that differences in methods
of resolving topographic features are important. The mean elevation of
the North American continent is substantially higher in the models than
is observed, which may contribute to the overall dry bias of the models
over that area. The authors do not find a clear association between the
mean topography of a model and its mean W simulation, however. which suggests
that the bias over land is not purely a matter of orography. The seasonal
cycle of W is reasonably well simulated by the models, although over North
America they have a tendency to become moister more quickly in the spring
than is observed. The interannual component of the variability of W is
not well captured by the models over North America. Globally, the simulated
W values show a signal correlated with the Southern Oscillation index but
the observations do not. This discrepancy may be related to deficiencies
in the radiosonde network, which does not sample the tropical ocean regions
well. Overall, the interannual variability of W, as well as its climatology
and mean seasonal cycle, are better described by the median of the 28 simulations
than by individual members of the ensemble. Tests to learn whether simulated
precipitable water, evaporation, and precipitation values may be related
to aspects of model formulation yield few clear signals, although the authors
find, for example, a tendency for the few models that predict boundary
layer depth to have large values of evaporation and precipitation. Controlled
experiments, in which aspects of model architecture are systematically
varied within individual models, may be necessary to elucidate whether
and how model characteristics influence simulations.&nbsp;
