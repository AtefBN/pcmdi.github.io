and biases. Abstracts of the First International AMIP Scientific Conference,
Monterey, California, 10.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>In support of IPCC 95, PCMDI has produced two analyses of the AMIP
for a chapter on model validation. These IPCC analyses have since been
expanded to provide a fuller overview of model performance. This paper
focuses on the "base" or "climate" state and systematic deviations of the
30 model solutions from "best" observations, i.e., "how good is the climate."

<P>The base state is defined by seasonal means of the standard monthly
mean output averaged from 1980-88. 1979 was not considered because validation
data in the atmosphere was lacking, and to avoid contributions to the mean
from potential transients forced by anomalous adjustments in the land surface
hydrology. In addition to the climate average, the interannual variation
of the seasonal mean is examined, as appropriate.

<P>Model performance is evaluated along three broad categories: 1) "the
climate," i.e., surface air temperature and precipitation climatology [as
might be defined by physical geographers and the public]; 2) the "meteorology"
or atmospheric general circulation features and synoptic activity as represented
by monthly mean AMIP standard output variances; and 3) "energy" or the
net energy fluxing into and out of the atmosphere.

<P>The overarching conclusion is that variation among the 30 models is
an order of magnitude greater than the variation among the observational
estimates for many of the variables considered. Hence, while clear "losers"
might be identified, clear "winners" cannot. Additional results regarding
surface air temperature biases over the ocean and a severe net surface
shortwave bias over the summer time midlatitude oceans will be covered
at the conference.
