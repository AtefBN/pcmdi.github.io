<BR>Within the framework of the AMIP -- Atmospheric Model Intercomparison
Project (Gates, 1992), Diagnostic Subproject on Polar Phenomena and Sea
Ice, an intercomparison and a comparison against observation have been
undertaken of precipitation and evaporation simulated by 23 AGCMs over
regions of relevance to high-latitude freshwater cycle. These are: the
Arctic Ocean (in this study -- bounded by 70&deg;N); its land watershed
basins (including land watersheds of individual Arctic seas, as in Ivanov,
1976); and the entire ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. The regions
under consideration correspond to three major forms of freshwater input
into the ocean: precipitation, river run-off and iceberg discharge from
glaciers. The AGCMs have been run for the 10-year period 1979-88, with
the same SST and sea-ice extent prescribed from observation. Observationally-derived
estimates of precipitation are based on global (Legates and Willmott, 1990)
and regional (Bryazgin, 1976; Bryazgin and Shver, 1976) climatologies (hereinafter
-- LW, B. and BS, correspondingly). Additional data on precipitation are
monthly fields of Jaeger (1983) and monthly areal averages of Vowinckel
and Orvig (1970). Estimates of evaporation for the regions considered are
obtained from Zubenok (1976) and WWB (1974). WWB (1974) and IPCC (1990)
provide estimates of iceberg discharge from the ice sheets (both estimates
are based on the assumption of the ice sheets' mass equilibrium).
