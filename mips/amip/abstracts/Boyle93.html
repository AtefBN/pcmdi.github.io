<B>Boyle, J. S., </B>1993: Preliminary validation of the low frequency
variability of tropospheric temperature and circulation simulated for the
AMIP by the ECMWF model. PCMDI Report 11, Program for Climate Model Diagnosis
and Intercomparison, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 22 pp.

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The ECMWF global model (cycle 36) is used to simulate the climate from
1979 to 1988. This integration is in support of the WGNE Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Project (AMIP). The model uses the observed monthly sea
surface temperature for the ten year period during the integration. Anomaly
correlation and RMS calculations are carried out between monthly mean observed
circulation (ECMWF analyses and MSU channel 2 temperatures) and the model
results, although the use of monthly mean data restricts the conclusions
to the low frequency variability. The variables and regions considered
are the 500 hPa geopotential and MSU temperatures for the Northern Hemisphere
(30N to 70N), the 200 hPa zonal wind and MSU temperatures for the equatorial
belt (15S to 15N), and the 1000 hPa zonal wind for the equatorial Pacific
(15N to 15S and 120E to 100W). The results show: (1) For the midlatitude
500 hPa geopotential there is a signal in the model results for the ENSO
events of 1982/83 and 1986/87; (2) the model underestimates the midlatitude
500 hPa geopotential interannual variability as measured by the RMS but
overestimates the MSU temperature variability in this region; (3) in general,
outside of the ENSO periods, there is little correlation between the model
and observed data anomalies of midlatitude 500 hPa geopotential; (4) in
the tropics the variables evince a stronger correlation with observations
in the interannual variation; (5) in the tropics the model underestimates
the variability of the 200 hPa wind and MSU temperature; (6) the model,
although non-interacting with the ocean, produces a credible simulation
of the low frequency variability of the equatorial Pacific low level zonal
wind.
