<BR>A 10-year integration of the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction
System (NOGAPS) has been performed as part of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison
Project. The intraseasonal variability in the model's tropical heating
and 200-mb winds are assessed through a comparison with daily averaged
ECMWF analyses and MSU derived oceanic precipitation estimates. The relationships
between the primary modes of 20-70 day variability in the Northern Hemisphere
winds and tropical heating are established through empirical orthogonal
function (EOF) and composite analyses. The results indicate that deficiencies
in the simulated variability of tropical heating may have a significant
impact on the simulation of extratropical wind field variability.

<P>The intraseasonal variability of precipitation in NOGAPS is much weaker
than the observed variability over most of the globe, with the exception
of isolated regions around Central America and Madagascar. This suggests
that the model simulates the Madden-Jullian Oscillation (MJO) poorly. Hovm&ouml;ller
diagrams of 200 mb velocity potential along the equator show a westward
propagating wave number one signal in the simulation, however, it is much
weaker and less coherent than in the observations. The simulated MJO also
has a maximum amplitude in the Western Hemisphere, while the observed MJO
has a maximum amplitude in the Eastern Hemisphere.

<P>The variability of the model's 200 mb winds is too weak in the tropics
and subtropics of the Indian ocean Pacific regions, while it is adequate
or too strong at higher latitudes and in the Atlantic region. EOF and composite
analyses indicate that the model's weak representation of the MJO may be
responsible for the deficient subtropical variability in the model's upper-tropospheric
wind fields. Observed modes of intraseasonal variability that have a clear
connection to tropical precipitation are poorly simulated by NOGAPS, and
in regions where these observed modes dominate, such as the North Pacific,
the simulated variability is severely underestimated. Observed modes of
intraseasonal variability that do not show any significant relationship
to tropical convection are well simulated, especially in regions where
these extratropically forced modes dominate, such as the North Atlantic.
