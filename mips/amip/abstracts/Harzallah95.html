Emphasis is put on interannual variability of sea level pressureand 500-hPa geopotential height for the Northern Hemisphere winter. Inview of the large systematic errors related to the relatively small numberof realizations, unbiased variance estimators have been developed Althoughstatistical significance is not reached in some extratropical regions,large significant extratropical responses are found at the North Pacific-Alaskasector for SLP and over western Canada and the Aleutians for 500-hPa geopotentialheight The influence of SST variations on internal variability is alsoexamined by using a 7-year simulation using the climatological SST seasonalcycle. It is found that interannual SST changes strongly influence thegeographical distribution of internal variability; in particular, it tendsto increase it over oceans. Patterns of internal and external variabilityof the 500-hPa geopotential height are further examined by using EOF decompositions.showing that the model realistically simulates the leading observed variabilitymodes. The geographical structure of internal variability patterns is foundto be similar to that of total variability, although similar modes tendto evolve rather differently in time. The zonally symmetric seesaw dominatesthe internal variability for both observed and climatologically prescribedSST. The Pacific-North American (PNA ) and Western Pacific (WP) patterns,on the other hand, are the dominant modes associated with patterns of SSTvariability; the latter is related to Atlantic anomalies. while the formerresponds to both El Ni&ntilde;o events and extratropical forcing.
