<B>Phillips, T. J.,</B> 1994: A summary documentation of the
AMIP models. PCMDI Report 18, Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison,
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 343 pp.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">This report summarizes essential features of the global
atmospheric models of some 30 groups that are participating in the Atmospheric
Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP), an international effort to simulate
the climate of the period 1979-1988 with common ocean boundary conditions
and radiative forcings. Salient features of the AMIP models are summarized
in tabular form, and the principal numerical, dynamical, and physical properties
of each model are described in greater detail as well.
