<B>Lambert, J.,</B> J. Sheng and J. Boyle, 1995: Cyclone frequencies
and intraseasonal variability in GCMs (Diagnostic Subproject 3). Abstracts
of the First International AMIP Scientific Conference, Monterey, California,
75.

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>As part of a diagnostic subproject, we present various aspects of the
cyclone climatologies and intraseasonal variability simulated by models
participating in the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP).

<P>The geographical distribution of the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern
Hemisphere winter cyclone frequencies are presented and compared to the
corresponding statistics obtained from observations.

<P>The interannual variability of the simulated climatologies is examined
by computing the year-to-year changes in the number of simulated cyclones
as a function of central pressure. The simulated interannual variability
is compared to the observed variability during the AMIP period, 1979-1988.
