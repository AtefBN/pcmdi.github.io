<BR>This paper summarizes the results of a 10-year integration of the MRI
GCMs participating in the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP).
Models are integrated with the lower boundary conditions of the observed
SST and sea ice distributions from January 1979 to December 1988. Standard
outputs with the 15-layer model are compared to observations and to those
with the 5 layer tropospheric model. It is shown that some of model deficiencies
in the 5 layer model reported in previous papers are improved in the new
15-layer model climatology. Some of the differences in interannual variations
in the midlatitudes corresponding to the tropical SST forcing between the
two models can be attributed to different model climatology.
