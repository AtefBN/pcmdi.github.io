<BR>In an effort to evaluate the ability of atmospheric general circulation
models to simulate observed monsoon variations we have analyzed many of
the models participating in the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project,
a coordinated experiment to simulate the period 1979-88. We have found
that the ability of a model to correctly simulate interannual variations
is regionally dependent and related to its ability to correctly respond
to remote SST forcing and to portray a realistic climatology (Sperber and
Palmer 1994). The use of a regional rainfall index as a means of model
verification has proven to be a stringent test of a models ability to simulate
interannual variations. With regard to the influence of the remote SST
forcing, nearly half of the models evaluated exhibited fundamental difficulties
by their failure to even realize the correct phase of the observed all-India
rainfall/SST teleconnection. Using such teleconnections provides an objective
means of stratifying model performance. We find that the link between Indian
monsoon rainfall and SST is strongest under ENSO conditions, particularly
when substantial anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean persist during
June-September. At other times little or no consensus among the simulations
exists with regard to Indian monsoon rainfall, even in the initial condition
sensitivity simulations performed with the ECMWF model. Contrary to this,
the simulations of Nordeste rainfall variations are more coherent owing
to fact that their dominant controlling factor is tropical SSTs. Also,
examination of the ECMWF initial condition sensitivity integrations indicates
that the simulation Nordeste rainfall variations is much less sensitive
to the specification of initial conditions.
