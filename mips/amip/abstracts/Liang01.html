<p>AMIP model simulations of the east China (5-50&deg;N; 105-122&deg;E)
monsoon system are analyzed to study coherent relationships between rainfall
and wind annual cycle biases. A comparison with observed interannual variability
patterns is carried out to identify the physical processes that explain
the biases. The analyses show that poleward displacement of the simulated
east Asian jet stream causes the ascending branch of the jet-induced transverse
circulation to move north and, as a consequence, produces negative (positive)
rainfall biases occur in central (northeast) China. The model simulations
show decreased southwesterly flow and ITCZ rainfall over the South China
Sea when weaker (versus observations) summer Hadley and Walker circulations
are present. This results from diminished model tropical disturbance activity,
and highlights the importance of air-sea interactions. In addition, during
October-January, intensified model low-level easterlies enhance moisture
transport and produce positive local rainfall biases over central and northeast
China. Biases in the east China monsoon system are concurrently reflected
in the planetary circulation. Enhanced northeast China rainfall results
from increased surface pressure over the North Pacific and an amplified
zonal pressure gradient along the east China coast. This bias pattern is
associated with differences in model representations of topography. On
the other hand, the South China Sea experiences an extensive elongated
meridional rainfall bias dipole structure that straddles the equator. This
is accompanied by a baroclinic vertical pattern over the tropics as well
as a barotropic wave train that extends from Australia to the Antarctic,
where the teleconnection is likely a direct atmospheric response to tropical
convective heating.
