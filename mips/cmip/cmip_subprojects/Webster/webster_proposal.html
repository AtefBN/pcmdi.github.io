My research group and I have been doing a lot of monsoon work over
the years: both South and East Asian as well as East African, the
latter more recently. In particular, we have been interested in
flooding  and have carried out a number of studies where we drive
hydrological models with GCM precipitation or precipitation
forecasts. Our main concern has been forecasting floods in Bangladesh
and we have developed methods for forecasting on a variety of time
scales. 
We have been rather successful but would like to ask similar
questions about degrees of flooding in a warming world. We are aware
of the paper
Palmer TN, Ralsanen J, Quantifying the risk of extreme seasonal
precipitation events in a changing climate (<i>Nature 415</i>: 512-514,
Jan 31 2002) and, in fact, I have discussed the results with Tim
Palmer extensively. They find the return period of extreme rainfall
shortened considerably. We would like to apply our hydrological
models to the CMIP doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide output to assess 
the impact of flooding in
Bangladesh and, at the same time, extend the analysis to the other
monsoon regions listed above. I am happy to work with Palmer and
Ralsanen on this project if they would like.
