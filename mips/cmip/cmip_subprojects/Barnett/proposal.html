<H1 ALIGN = CENTER> Analysis of Variance in the CMIP Coupled Models </H1>

<P> 
The proposed subproject relates to work our Detection Group
is undertaking regarding natural variability in CGCMs.  We had
decided to look at three CGCM runs (MPI, Hadley Center and GFDL) and compare
the natural variability in their three-dimensional temperature fields.  This has obvious
implications for GHG signal detection.  At the February 1997 AMS meeting in Long Beach
we were told 
that CMIP has a far more extensive collection of models than we had
originally planned to analyze.  We felt that extending the analysis to
this broader set would be highly desirable.

<P>
Given the above, I request, on behalf of the Group, that we be
allowed to participate with CMIP in the analysis of the 3D temperature
variability in the CGCM runs that CMIP has acquired.  
Our original plan was to do a fairly straightforward analysis of variance
(projection onto a common EOF basis set, etc.) but we would be glad to help
in any reasonable way we can.  We do have limited resources so we need to
stick to a sharply focused study that will carry over directly to our
detection algorithms.

<P>
The analysis would be done by some combination of Santer, Hegerl and
Barnett -- the mix depending on discussion with CMIP and our internal
progress on the rest of the detection study.
