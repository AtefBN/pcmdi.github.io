I've been communicating with Ken Sperber about the possibility
of using coupled GCM data archived by PCMDI to study
convectively-coupled equatorial waves.
Ken asked me to
send a paragraph or two describing the proposed analysis.
Here is the relevant text from a draft of a proposal
that I am writing in  collaboration with George Kiladis of the
NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory and Kathy Straub of Susquehanna
University:
<p>
The dispersion relationships of CCEWs
simulated in a number of GCMs resemble their observational counterparts 
only in a limited way.  In order to understand what causes this discrepancy, 
we propose to perform a detailed comparison of simulated and observed waves.  
This comparison will involve both comparing power spectra of convective proxies 
and comparing dynamical and thermodynamical structures of waves.  

<h3>Comparing Power Spectra</h3>
<p>
By examining the space-time power spectra of fields such as OLR or precipitation,
one can quickly ascertain whether CCEWs are present, and if they have realistic dispersion 
relationships.  We plan to perform such comparisons for a variety of GCMs with a variety
of convective parameterizations.  Two key questions are:
1) which of the traditional convective parameterizations produce the most 
realistic dispersion curves and 2) do cloud-resolving or superparameterizations
do a better job?  Much of the data for these analysis will be provided by the 
Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison at Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory, which is currently archiving data for coupled GCM runs in support 
of the 4th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  David 
Randall of Colorado State University has agreed to provide data for a 
superparameterization run.

<h3>Comparing Dynamical and Thermodynamical Structures</h3>
<p>
For several GCMs we will examine in detail the dynamical and thermodynamical
structure of simulated CCEWs.  These structures will be obtained by filtering 
model output following the approach of Wheeler et al. (2000).  We hope to explain 
why in some cases modeled waves are too weak or propagate too slowly.  For example, 
inadequate representation of shallow convection or stratiform precipitation
(Lin and Mapes 2004) 
are suspects.  We will use vertical mode decompositions to isolate circulations 
associated with the various convective morphologies.  We will also evaluate the 
thermodynamics of the simulated waves; e.g. do they have realistic moisture perturbations 
and the same phase relationships between boundary layer entropy and tropospheric temperature?  
If one or more of the models does a good job of representing the waves, this analysis may also 
provide insight on the dynamics of CCEWs.
