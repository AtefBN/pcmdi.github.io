<H2> Background </H2>
<P>
The seasonal forecasting of the Asian-Australian monsoon is of interest 
both for scientific and economical reasons.  In order to forecast the
monsoon accurately, it is important to understand the monsoon variability
with respect to physical processes assocaited with it.  We have to rely
heavily on numerical models for monsoon forecasting, and it is pertinent
to ask if the present generation of numerical models reproduces the monsoon
variability accurately.  A critical comparison between observational data
and models will show where the discrepancy is and how numerical models can 
be improved further.  Despite its importance, the seasonal and longterm
forecasting of the monsoon, at present, is in a crawling stage.  In this 
study, the potential of the so-called super-ensemble forecasting method 
(Krishnamurti et al. 2000a, b) will be explored as it applies to the 
seasonal and longterm forecasting of the monsoon.  It is essential then, 
to assess the accuracy of individual models, which is an integral component 
of the super-ensemble strategy.
<H2> Objectives </H2> 
<P>
One of primary objectives in the proposed study is the analysis of model
statistics (primarily second-moment statistics) and their comparisons 
with observational data.  The model statistics we intend to calculate 
are the variance, spatial correlation, temporal correlation, EOFs and
cyclostationary EOFs (CSEOFs; Kim and North 1997).  Such an analysis 
will show how accurate is the present generation of numerical models in
reproducing physical processes in the observational data.  More importantly,
however, the analysis results will show how individual numerical models can 
be improved further.  The second primary objective is the development of 
EOF- or CSEOF-based super-ensemble forecasting method using model outputs.  
<H2> Methodology </H2>
<P>
The second-moment statistics (including EOFs and cyclostationary EOFs) 
of the model outputs will be examined on several different time scales
including diurnal, seasonal, and annual scales (Kim et al. 1996).  A 
comparison of the model statistics with those of the observational data 
will reveal whether the present generation of numerical models is 
sufficiently accurate for the development of a super-ensemble forecasting
method.  More importantly, however, such a comparison will critically show
whether a certain physical process is accurately handled in numerical
models and its prediction limit set by numerical models.  We intend to use
CSEOF analysis extensively, which is more apt for extracting time-dependent 
physical processes (Kim and Chung 2000).  The observational data sets we 
will use include, but are not limited to, da Silva et al. (1994) surface data, 
NCEP daily and monthly reanalysis (Kalnay et al. 1994), ocean assimilation 
data (Giese and Carton 1999; Carton et al. 2000a, b) and Xie-Arkin 
precipitation data (Xie and Arkin 1997).
<P>
A super-ensemble forecasting method will be developed in EOF or CSEOF space
rather than in physical space in order to take  advantage of spatial and
temporal correlations of physical processes.  A preliminary test strongly
indicates that the performance of a super-ensemble method can significantly 
be improved by resolving the spatio-temporal correlation structures of 
physical processes appropriately.  The super-ensemble method in CSEOF 
space will also show the predictability of each physical process.  Such
information is critical in addressing the inherent predictability of the
monsoon, the source of prediction uncertainty, and specific directions of 
model improvement for better forecasting.
