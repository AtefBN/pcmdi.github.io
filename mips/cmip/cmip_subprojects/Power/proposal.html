Background/Objectives</H1>
Ocean temperature is expected to change in response to global warming.
Part of this results from the direct uptake of anomalous surface heat.
This heat, together with changes in the wind-stress and freshwater fluxes
can also alter ocean currents and mixing rates, and this too can effect
the way heat is distributed within the ocean. We might call this latter
effect the "dynamic" response to global warming. The purpose of this sub-project
is to estimate the magnitude of this dynamic effect over the first 80 years
of transient CO2 experiments in coupled GCMs. We also wish to determine
the relative importance of the dynamic response, how it arises, where it
is large and which particular fluxes are most important in driving it.
Recent work suggests that the dynamic effect acts to boost the surface
response on these time-scales by over 30% (Power 1998). This is based on
the results obtained from one particular model only (Power et al. 1993,
Colman et al. 1995) and so it is worth testing the conclusions drawn in
a variety of other models, especially in the models which exhibit less
climate drift.
<H1>
Method</H1>
The method used will be similar to that described by Power (1998) and is
similar in philosophy to that described by Power and Hirst (1997). We will
use the surface fluxes from the CGCMs (both control and perturbed values)
to drive an ocean model and a hybrid coupled model (Power et al. 1995).
The heat will be used to drive the temperature equation and a passive tracer
equation, in order to estimate the dynamic response to heating.
<H1>
Fields Required</H1>
The following 4x20 year mean fields are required from both the control
and perturbed integrations:
<OL>
<LI>
wind-stress (zonal and meridional)</LI>

<LI>
total heat flux</LI>

<LI>
total freshwater flux</LI>

<LI>
3-D ocean T and S</LI>

<LI>
sea-ice thickness and concentration</LI>

<LI>
overturning in various basins</LI>
</OL>
