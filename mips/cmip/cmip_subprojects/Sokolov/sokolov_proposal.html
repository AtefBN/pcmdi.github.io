Climate sensitivity and the rate of heat uptake by the deep ocean 
are believed to be the most important characteristics defining the 
transient response of climate models to external forcings.  
Differences between results of climate change simulations 
produced by existing coupled AOGCMs are in large part due to 
differences in these two characteristics. The direct comparison of 
climate change projections from different AOGCMs, however, 
does not allow one to separate contributions of these two 
parameters.
<P>
A 2D climate model was developed in the framework of the MIT 
Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change for 
studying uncertainties in climate change projections. This model 
consists of a two-dimensional (zonal averaged) atmospheric model 
developed from the GISS atmospheric GCM coupled to a diffusive 
ocean model. The model's sensitivity can be varied by changing 
the strength of the cloud feedback. As was shown in Sokolov and 
Stone (1998) the behavior of different coupled AOGCMs can be 
reproduced by simulations with the 2D climate model with an 
appropriate choice of the model's sensitivity and coefficient for 
heat diffusion in the deep ocean. It is important that we are able to 
reproduce responses of a given AOGCM to different forcings with 
a unique choice of these parameters.  
<P>
There are two ways to estimate the values of these parameters that 
allow us to match the behavior of a given AOGCM. The first is to 
use the model's climate sensitivity obtained from equilibrium 
climate change simulations (usually a doubled CO2 simulation) 
with the atmospheric sub-model coupled to a mixed layer ocean 
model together with surface air temperature from a run with the 
coupled AOGCM. Second, the values of the parameters in question 
can be defined from data for the surface air temperature and the 
thermal expansion of ocean from a run with the coupled AOGCM. 
The data for thermal expansion are available for at least some 
AOGCMs.

As discussed in Sokolov and Stone (1998) and Webster and 
Sokolov (2000), uncertainty in the rate of oceanic heat uptake 
plays an important role in defining the overall uncertainty in 
climate change projections. A methodology for studying 
uncertainty in climate change projections as described in Webster 
and Sokolov requires knowledge of the probability distributions for 
different parameters including the rate of heat uptake by the deep 
ocean. The distribution used in the above study was based on the 
results of climate change simulations with a rather few coupled 
AOGCMs. The proposed sub-project will allow us to construct 
more reliable distributions for use in future uncertainty studies and 
therefore obtain better estimates of the relative importance of 
uncertainty in oceanic heat uptake.
