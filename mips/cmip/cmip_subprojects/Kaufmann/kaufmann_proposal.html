I have published several papers that use statistical techniques to
analyze the relation between radiative forcing and surface temperature
[Kaufmann et al., in review; Kaufmann and Stern, 2002; Stern and
Kaufmann, 2000; Kaufmann and Stern, 1997]. In several, I have used the
regression results to estimate temperature sensitivity. These estimates
have elicited a variety of comments from physical scientists. Among the
most frequent is the question, what is the physical interpretation of
the statistical estimate of temperature sensitivity? That is, do the
regression coefficients measure a short run effect, the transient
climate response, the equilibrium response, or some intermediate effect?

<p>
I propose to answer this question by analyzing the CMIP2 experiments
with the same statistical techniques used in the aforementioned papers.
Specifically, I will estimate the relation between radiative forcing and
surface temperature for the full sample period and sub-samples that
include the period during which radiative forcing increases and
and is stable. I will use these regression results to
calculate temperature sensitivity. I will then compare them to the known
temperature sensitivities from the climate models. I hope this
comparison will help interpret the physical meaning of the temperature
sensitivities calculated from regression coefficients.

<p>
Towards this end, I request data on the CMIP2 experiments in which
radiative forcing is increased at about 1 percent per year until
radiative forcing doubles and then is simulated until temperature
reaches equilibrium. These data are equivalent to the data plot in
Figure 9.1 (in Chapter 9) of the TAR. Ideally, I would analyze results
from many simulations.

<p>
I understand that the simulations available are for about 80 years only. Although this is not the time-span I described in my original e-mail, I would still like to analyze them using the techniques I described in my pre-proposal.
