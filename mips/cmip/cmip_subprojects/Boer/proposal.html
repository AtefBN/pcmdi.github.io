<H2> Background to the intended research </H2>
<P>
The concept of "potential predictability" arose out of questions of
predictability on seasonal timescales. Predictability is a feature of
the system under examination and represents a measure of the "rate of
separation" of initially "close" states of the system or, if the
initial separation is considered to be error, of the growth of error in
a perfect forecast model. Studies of predictability which follow this
approach are prognostic and attempt to gain information on the growth
of error in the real or model system. For seasonal prediction, the
error in the seasonal mean surface air temperature, for instance, would
be of interest.
<P>
Potential predictability is a diagnostic, rather than prognostic,
concept. Here one asks if the "observations" of the real or a model
system exhibit behaviour which suggests that the seasonal means (or
some other quantity) behave in a way that indicate that they have a
predictable component. In particular, the assumption is that the
variation of the mean in question arises from contributions from
unpredictable "weather noise" and, possibly, also from a low-frequency
contribution which is at least potentially predictable.  The study of
the potential predictability of a system is the identification of such
a component at an acceptable level of statistical confidence.
 
<H2> Objectives </H2>
<P>
The proposed subproject will analyze the potential predictability in
the surface air temperature of the coupled models in CMIP at various
timescales including that of the annual, pentadal and decadal means. An
attempt will be made to compare the location and nature of the
potential predictability in the various models, to connect it to
various coupled processes and oscillations in so far as that is
possible, and to infer the effect of spin-up methodology, flux
correction, and resolution on the results.
<P>
Potential predictability analysis has the potential to reveal
interesting similarities and differences in model behaviour which are
of direct interest to CLIVAR and to modellers in general since it tries
to separate out information on long-term coupled processes from the
passive response to weather noise.

<H2> Methodology </H2>
<P>
The study which will identify regions of potential predict and possible
connection to mechanisms as in Boer (1997) following the methods in
that paper and the potential predictability methods discussed in Zwiers
(1996) and von Storch and Zwiers (1998). Some "validation" may be
possible using the GISST data set.
