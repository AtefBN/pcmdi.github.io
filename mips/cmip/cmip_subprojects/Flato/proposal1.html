<H2> Background </H2>
<P>
     Model projections of greenhouse-gas-induced climate warming indicate
enhanced sensitivity at high latitudes owing largely to positive feedbacks
involving sea-ice and snow (e.g. Mitchell et al., 1990; Kattenberg et al.,
1996; Rind et al., 1995). A worry is that this sensitivity may be an artifact
of the crude treatment of sea-ice and snow processes in such models. For
example, some coupled models treat sea-ice as a motionless thermodynamic
slab, ignoring ice deformation and advection, while others use a simple
"ice drift" approach. Some coupled models do include more realistic treatments 
of ice dynamics and the snowpack on land, and comparison of the models 
participating in CMIP will allow some evaluation of whether improvements in 
the models' representation of cryospheric processes indeed improves simulation 
of the cryosphere, and the climate as a whole.

<H2> Objectives </H2>
<P>
     Our goal is to measure the models' ability to simulate snow and ice and 
to relate errors in these quantities to model parameterizations of cryospheric 
processes or biases in other aspects of the climate system. 

<H2> Methodology </H2>
<P>
     We will assemble data sets of observed snow and ice extent, and available
estimates of snow and ice thickness. We will compute from these data, and from
the model output, various large-scale quantities like snow-covered area in
North America and Eurasia, ice-covered area and maximum thickness in the NH and
SH etc. Where possible, the difference, model minus observed, will be used as 
a measure of model performance for each of these quantities, and from 
descriptions of the model parameterizations, we will seek commonalities between
those models which perform well and those which do not (e.g. do models which 
include ice dynamics have a smaller error in ice extent than those which do 
not? Do models which include flux adjustment have a smaller error? Does model 
error in snow extent decrease with increasing sophistication of the land-
surface scheme?). An initial examination of some of these relationships was 
conducted by G.J. Boer and S. Lambert and presented in Gates et al. (1996).
     We will also explore relationships between errors in other available 
quantities (e.g. overturning streamfunction, surface pressure patterns) and 
cryospheric variables. Since time-series of cryospheric quantities are not 
available from CMIP, we will examine the correlation between surface air 
temperature and ice/snow line in our model to see if it can be used as a proxy 
for cryospheric variability in the other participating models (for example, 
the location of the 0-degree isotherm should be a fairly good indicator of ice 
edge location, at least in winter).


<H2> Data Requirements </H2>
<P>
     We will use the basic CMIP model output: atmospheric surface fields
(especially snow and ice depth); ocean annual means and zonal cross-sections;
and surface air temperature time-series. In addition we will make use of 
climatological data available at our institution (e.g. ice and snow extent, 
surface air temperature and pressure, ocean temperature and salinity).
