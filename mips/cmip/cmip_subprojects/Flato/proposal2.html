<h2>Background</h2>
<p>     Model projections of greenhouse-gas-induced climate warming indicate
enhanced sensitivity at high latitudes owing largely to positive feedbacks
involving sea-ice and snow (e.g. Mitchell et al., 1990; Kattenberg et al.,
1996; Rind et al., 1995). A worry is that this sensitivity may be an artifact
of the crude treatment of sea-ice and snow processes in such models. For
example, some coupled models treat sea-ice as a motionless thermodynamic
slab, ignoring ice deformation and advection, while others use a simple
"ice drift" approach. 
<p>     In the course of my CMIP1 subproject, I compared the (control) model 
results and produced tables and figures for both ice and snow for use in 
the IPCC TAR (Chapter 8). The results indicated no clear connection between
errors in simulated ice or snow extent (i.e. difference between model and
observed climatology) and the level of sophistication of the model
parameterizations of ice or snow. There was some tendency for models
employing flux adjustment to have smaller errors, but this was not 
universally true. Although I believe these intercomparison results
are a valuable contribution to the IPCC TAR, the rather limited analysis 
possible using the CMIP1 results precludes a stand-alone publication at 
this point.
<p>     In this proposal, I wish to expand on my CMIP1 study by investigating
the relationship between fidelity of the control run simulation of ice
and snow, and the changes, both in ice and snow and also in other climatic
quantities (notably surface air temperature), which occur as a result of
greenhouse-gas forcing.


<h2>Objectives</h2>
<P>     The goals of this proposal are twofold:
<ol>
       <li> to assess the extent to which parameterizations of cryospheric 
          process impact the response of a coupled model to greenhouse
          gas forcing.
 
       <li> to assess the extent to which errors in the control simulation
          of sea ice or snow impact the response of a coupled model to 
          greenhouse gas forcing. 
</ol>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>     The change in sea-ice extent and thickness, snow extent and depth, 
surface air temperature and other climatic quantities will be computed as
the difference between the first and last 20-year averages from the CMIP2
transient model runs. There is interest in these ice and snow difference 
plots for potential use in the IPCC TAR (U. Cubasch, pers. comm.) if they 
can be done in time. These differences will be stratified according to the 
type of cryospheric parameterization employed (e.g. ice dynamics vs. 
motionless ice) and according to the error (model minus observed) in sea-ice 
and snow extent determined in the previous CMIP1 subproject. Where suitable 
observations are not available (e.g. for sea-ice thickness), the model 
results will be stratified according to model means for these quantities 
(e.g. models which produce 'thin' sea ice vs. those which produce 'thick' 
sea ice relative to the ensemble model mean). 
<p>     The approach will then be to seach the results for common features
and relationships. For example, do models which include ice dynamics 
exhibit less high-latitude amplification in climate warming than those
which include motionless ice? -- a result expected from earlier ice-only 
model experiments (Hibler, 1984; Flato, 1996). Do models with unusually
deep snow in their control climates exhibit greater warming over land
than those with unusually shallow snow (a result which might be inferred
from the albedo feedback arguments of Fyfe and Flato [1998]). As a final
example, the CMIP1 results indicated a particularly large range in
simulated southern hemisphere ice extent -- is the magnitude of Antarctic
warming correlated with ice extent in the control climate?
<p>     Answers to these and other questions will useful in assessing the 
role of cryospheric processes in climate change, and will help guide future 
improvements in the representation of cryospheric processes in global climate 
models by illustrating aspects which have a potentially large impact on 
climate sensitivity. Results from this and the previous CMIP1 sub-project 
will be combined for publication.

<h2>Data Requirements</h2>
<p>     We will use the basic CMIP model output: atmospheric surface fields
(especially snow and ice depth); ocean annual means and zonal cross-sections;
and surface air temperature time-series. In addition we will make use of 
climatological data available at our institution (e.g. ice and snow extent, 
surface air temperature and pressure, ocean temperature and salinity).
