<H2> BACKGROUND </H2>
<P>
The biospheric carbon cycle is directly linked to the climate system.
CO<SUB>2</SUB> exchanges between the atmosphere and the biosphere are controlled
by atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration and surface climate conditions.
Elevated atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> increases plant photosynthesis through the
so-called fertilization effect. Climate change, through changes in
surface temperature, atmospheric humidity, soil temperature and
moisture, etc also affects the biospheric carbon storage through
imbalance between photosynthesis and organic matter decomposition.  On
the other hand, future atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> is controlled by
anthropogenic emissions but also by surface (land and ocean) CO<SUB>2</SUB> fluxes.
It is therefore extremely important to estimate in the context of future
climate what is the carbon cycle response to CO<SUB>2</SUB> increase and climatic
change. This subproject focus only on the biospheric compound of the
carbon cycle, but a similar subproject, in coordination with the OCMIP
activity could also be developed.

<H2> METHODOLOGY </H2>
<P>
We will use CASA/SLAVE, a global model of the biospheric carbon cycle
to estimate the biospheric response to the climate forcing. CASA/SLAVE
has been developed by the investigator, in collaboration with Chris
Field (Carnegie, Stanford, California) and Inez Fung (Berkeley,
California) over the past 5 years (Friedlingstein, et al, 1995a,
1999). The model estimates, on a monthly time step, the geographical
distribution of net primary productivity, carbon allocation in the
plant system, leaf fall, litter and soil decomposition, and net CO<SUB>2</SUB>
flux between the atmosphere and the biosphere.  It has been used for
several studies, such as present-day global carbon budget
(Friedlingstein, et al, 1995a), paleo studies (Friedlingstein, et al, 1995b) 
interannual atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> variability (Friedlingstein, et al, 1997) or
plant allocation under current and doubled CO<SUB>2</SUB> (Friedlingstein, et al, 
1999).
<P>
The model will be forced by atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> and monthly means of
surface temperature and precipitation field, available from the CMIP2
runs.  The model needs to be initialized to steady state using
constant climate, then it will be run over the CMIP2 period.
<P>
A preliminary study has been performed using the CMIP2 outputs from
the LMD GCM. The biospheric response to the atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> increase
is an important biospheric carbon uptake, but the climate induced
response, because of drying of the surface is a net release. The CO<SUB>2</SUB>
induced response being larger than the climate one, the combined
effect on the biosphere is a biospheric sink.
<P>
Using several CMIP2 GCM results will test the robustness of this
preliminary result.

<H2> FIELDS REQUIRED </H2>
<P>
The following monthly mean fields are required from both the control and
perturbed integrations: 
<OL>
  <LI> Surface Temperature
  <LI> Precipitation 
</OL>
