I would like to improve our understanding of the uncertainty in regional climate
sensitivity using CMIP monthly-mean surface air-temperature output.

Traditionally, the uncertainty in global mean warming to a CO2-doubling has been
characterized as 1.5 to 4.5 °C. What is the uncertainty in regional mean warming?

I propose to address this question using CMIP monthly mean surface air temperature
results.

To separate global uncertainties in climate sensitivity from regional, at each time period
I will divide the regional change in surface air temperature by the global mean change,
thus expressing regional climate sensitivity as a fraction of the global climate
sensitivity.

I intend to
<ul>
<li> compare the spatial and seasonal pattern of warming at such time as each model
reaches the same amount of global mean warming
<li> compare the spatial and seasonal pattern of warming at such time as each model
reaches the same amount of radiative forcing
<li> look at the temporal evolution of the spatial pattern within each model
<li> look at averaging and weighting strategies to improve the signal-to-noise ratio
</ul>

I expect to produce maps indicating the inter-model range of the ratio of regional to
global mean climate change. This value can be appropriately multiplied by the global
uncertainty to estimate regional uncertainty. I also plan to look at other statistics in
addition to inter-model range.

I think I can do this relatively quickly using CDMS and CDAT. I plan to work in
coordination with Curt Covey (PCMDI). Furthermore, I plan to distribute preliminary
results to Curt Covey, Karl Taylor, Ben Santer, Krishna AchutaRao, Starley
Thompson, and Phil Duffy (all of LLNL) for feedback and critical suggestions. I would
be delighted if others would be willing to offer guidance or assistance.

This project will be conducted on a "hobby" basis, as I have no funding to pursue this. I
hope it leads to a short paper in a high visibility journal.

<p>
I will also estimate from top of atmosphere fluxes the partial derivatives
<i>
dF<sub>longwave</sub> / dT, dF<sub>longwave</sub> / dln(pCO<sub>2</sub>) 
</i> and 
<i>
dF<sub>shortwave</sub> / dT, 
</i>
where <i>T</i> is surface temperature, and from these try to estimate climate sensitivity.
For this purpose
I will need only annual and global mean longwave and shortwave fluxes, 
<i>
pCO<sub>2</sub>,
</i>
and surface temperatures.
