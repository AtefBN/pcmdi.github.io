The approved AMIP II diagnostic subproject No.9 
<A HREF = "../../../amip/DIAGSUBS/sp9.htm">
"Polar Processes and Sea Ice"</A>
(J.E.Walsh, D.Bromwich, H.Cattle, V.Kattsov, V.Meleshko, J.Maslanik)
is focussed on AGCM-simulated fields that are most relevant to the
forcing of sea ice. While the scope of the subproject is sufficiently broad
to allow for the entrainment of additional investigators having polar
interests, several foci have emerged: (1) polar clouds and radiative fluxes,
(2) the polar water vapor fluxes (lateral as well as surface fluxes), and
(3) downslope airflow in the vicinity of ice sheet margins. A preliminary
analysis of early AMIP II results and an intercomparison of the coupled
IPCC DDC simulations have revealed some systematic errors (common both
to the AGCMs and AOGCMs) in simulations of surface air temperature,
precipitation, and sea level pressure in the Northern Polar region
(Walsh et al., 2001, in preparation). In addition, the across-model 
variance of near-surface atmospheric fields (e.g., temperature) appears to 
be larger in the IPCC DDC coupled models than in the AMIP-II models. We 
hypothesize that the differences in sea ice simulated by the coupled models 
are at least partly responsible for these differences in variance of the 
atmospheric fields. In order to test this hypothesis, we need to examine 
quantitatively the sea ice distributions in the coupled models. The CMIP 
archives contain sea ice distributions, in addition to the atmospheric fields 
required for a more complete analysis of the sea-ice atmosphere linkages. 
Therefore, adding CMIP model outputs to the above intercomparison would help 
to understand, e.g., to what extent coupling to an interactive ocean/sea-ice
model can be responsible for different systematic errors in the atmospheric
component (in high latitudes) of a coupled model.
