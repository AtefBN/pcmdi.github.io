<P>
I am interested in comparing observed temperature trends for recent
decades, as a function of altitude (1000 to 100 mbar) and
latitude, with coupled model simulations of global warming.
The simulations should be from one or more representative GCMs, taking
whatever CO<SUB>2</SUB> growth rate they might use.  Aerosols and ozone depletion
need not be included.
<P>
Satellite MSU data is a reliable source of observations for the
middle and upper troposphere (i.e., away from the lower troposphere
where the satellite vs. surface data is a matter of controversy).
Models predict that greenhouse warming maximizes at such altitudes.
The prediction is connected with water vapor and lapse rate feedback, so
this study might investigate zonal mean humidity as well.
