Introduction</H2>
The ocean is an important component of the climate system. It, together
with the atmosphere, is responsible for the redistribution of the global
incoming solar radiation and therefore the maintenance of the climate.
While the ocean heat transport is crucial to the climate and climate change,
its characteristics are only poorly known. Indirect estimates based on
atmospheric fluxes are subject to many uncertainties (Trenberth and Solomon
1994) and direct estimates using oceanographic observations are few. Modelling
studies (Cohen-Solal and Le Treut 1997) show that uncertainties in the
ocean heat transport have a large impact on the atmospheric circulation.
Often the ocean heat transport computed from an ocean model (or the ocean
component of a coupled model) differs from that derived from observed atmospheric
fluxes or implied by atmospheric models. In a coupled ocean-atmosphere
general circulation model, such a discrepancy will lead to a climate drift
which introduces great uncertainties to the understanding of anthropogenic
climate change. Recent advances in both atmospheric and ocean general circulation
models have resulted in much improved coupled models in which the ocean
heat transport from the ocean component is the same as that implied by
the atmospheric component for integrations of a few centuries (e.g. Boville
and Gent 1998). This compatibility generally improves the simulation of
sea surface temperature, but the sea surface salinity and the ocean interior
may still experience significant drift, which is expected to affect the
climate system on a longer time scale.
<P>Studies with ocean general circulation models (Boning et al. 1996) indicate
that in the North Atlantic, the ocean heat transport is highly correlated
to the strength of the meridional overturning circulation. The latter,
in turn, depends on how well the model represents the formation and transport
of the North Atlantic Deep Water. In a similar way the heat transport in
the southern hemisphere is expected to be influenced by the formation and
transport of the Antarctic Bottom Water. We expect similar relationships
to hold in coupled models, but then any errors can have widespread effects
on the total climate response.
<P>Because of the potential importance of these effects, we propose using
the CMIP results to investigate the sensitivity of heat transport to the
oceanic structure and ocean circulation in a coupled system. The CMIP study
has the advantage that a number of different models and parameterisations
are involved so this allows us to see beyond the specific behaviour of
an individual model.
<H2>
Objectives</H2>

<OL>
<LI>
To assess how well the coupled models reproduce the observed ocean heat
transport.</LI>

<LI>
To examine the relative roles of the meridional overturning circulation
and gyre circulation in determining the ocean heat transport in coupled
models.</LI>

<LI>
To identify factors (e.g. air-sea fluxes, the mean temperature and salinity
distributions, the formation and properties of deep and bottom water masses,
boundary currents) which contribute to the discrepancies in heat transport
between models and between models and observations.</LI>
</OL>

<H2>
Methodology</H2>
The ocean heat transport in the coupled models will be compared and validated
against indirect observational estimates based on atmospheric fluxes (e.g.
Trenberth and Solomon 1994) and direct estimates using oceanographic observations
(e.g. Hall and Bryden 1982; Bryden et al. 1991). In particular, recent
estimates from the WOCE database will be used as they become available.
<P>The temperature field (zonally averaged) combined with the meridional
overturning circulation will be used to estimate the mass transport at
different temperature classes which will be compared with other estimates
(e.g. Macdonald and Wunsch 1996). This calculation gives an estimate of
the contribution to the heat transport by the meridional overturning. Similarly
the contribution of the gyre circulation to the heat transport will be
estimated using the vertically integrated mass transport streamfunction
and the temperature field (vertically averaged).
<P>In order to establish the correlation between the ocean heat transport
and the oceanic structure and ocean circulation, we will carry out a detailed
examination of the temperature and salinity distributions in each of the
coupled models. Comparisons will be made with the available climatologies
(e.g. Levitus, 1982), recent observational datasets (e.g. WOCE) and output
from high resolution ocean models (e.g. CME and OCCAM).
<P>The analysis will be based on the output from CMIP2 control experiments
(20-year means) and the annual mean fields from CMIP1.
