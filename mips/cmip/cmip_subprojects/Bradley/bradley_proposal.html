In the IPCC 2001 Working Group 1 Report,
Figure 9.8 shows zonal mean temperature
change, averaged over several models, for CMIP2 simulations.  I am
interested in this because in the upper panel, the result shows that
maximum changes might be expected both at low elevations in the Arctic, and
at high elevations in the Tropics.  As you know, tropical ice caps have
been melting at a phenomenal rate, yet our instrumental data from high
elevations is very limited.  I've plotted
the distribution of GSN stations along the axis of the Cordillera, from Alaska
to S. Chile and the mean annual freezing level.  There is a clear
gap between Colorado (Niwot Ridge!) and Chile at high elevations.  I am
pressing NOAA to include some stations in their expanded GCOS network to
fill that gap.  It would be most useful to extract a similar plot as in
Figure 9.8, but just for this transect (as opposed to global zonal
averages).
<p>
To do this I will require the CMIP GCM data  (delta T, by pressure
level for each grid box).  The other issue involves where the signal/noise
might be maximized.  My gut feeling is that the variance of temperature at
low elevations in the Arctic is much higher than in the mid-troposphere in
the Tropics, so in terms of detection of a climate change signal, the
observational gap in the Tropical zone becomes critical.  But to get at
that, I'd have to somehow evaluate control run variance versus the
projected temperature change. Something like that was done in
Figure 9.8 (lower panel) but it's hard to see what the patterns really are
with the color scale that was chosen.  I'd like to re-examine this for
different models, and for the Americas transect.
