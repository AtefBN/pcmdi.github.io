Background
</H2>

<P>
Recently, an interactive phenomenon in the southern mid-to-high latitudes
has been observed with eastward propagating signals in both oceanic and 
atmospheric variables. This has been termed the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave 
(ACW) by White and Peterson (1996) (hereafter WP). There are several well 
defined features. First, local signals in fields of sea surface temperature
(SST), pressure at sea level (PSL), meridional wind stress, and sea ice 
extent are generated every 4-5 years. Second, these signals are phase-locked 
and move eastward, encircling the globe in about 8-10 years. Third, at any 
instant, there is a predominant wavenumber 2 spatial pattern. WP hypothesized
that there exists a teleconnection between the ACW and El Nino Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO) events. In a separate study, Jacobs and Mitchell (1996)
confirmed the wavenumber 2 pattern in an analysis using altimeter data.

<P>
Subsequently, ACW-like phenomena have been found in coupled ocean-atmosphere
models (Christoph et al. 1997, hereafter CBR; and Motoi et al. 1997; Cai et 
al. 1998 hereafter CBG). In the CBR and CBG studies, the eastward movement 
appears in the SST anomalies but not in other aforementioned fields. In those
fields the signal is dominated by standing oscillations and there is no phase-
locking. Although local signals are generated every 4-5 years as in the 
observed, the SST signal  takes 12-16 years to complete a circuit around the 
pole, and there is a predominant wavenumber 3 pattern. The results from the 
Motoi et al. (1997) coupled model show propagating signals in the SST together
with standing oscillations in other fields, and in their model there is a
preferred wavenumber 2 pattern. But SST anomalies would take 20-30 years 
to complete a circuit. They argued that their modelled ACW is closely related
to ENSO activities.

<P>
Earlier, the feature of a dominant quasi-stationary wavenumber 3 pattern in 
southern mid-to-high latitude  variability has been reported in many 
observational studies on day-to-day, interseasonal, and interannual time 
scales. In particular, Mo and White (1985) (hereafter MW) demonstrated 
that there are preferred locations (centers) for the strongest anomalies for 
the southern winter season. They correlated time series of PSL at a base point
with values at other grid points and showed a wavenumber 3 pattern. When the 
base point was moved away by 10 degrees in either direction, the pattern 
disappeared.  A similar feature was produced by the CSIRO coupled model (CBG).

Objectives
</H2>

This subproject intends to examine relevant issues by using the monthly mean 
SST  and SLP global fields over a time length of 30 years  that some of the
modeling groups have submitted for CMIP. In particular, focus will be placed 
on the  wavenumber-pattern of anomalies, the presence or the lack of the 
phase-locking of the oceanic and atmospheric anomalies, and the possible 
teleconnection with ENSO in these models (although one understands that ENSO 
is not properly simulated in these models). As an entry point, the dominant 
pattern of variability on interseasonal time scale can also be examined and 
bench-marked against the results of the MW study. It is hoped that this study 
will give a cursory feeling for the ACW in the models. This may point to 
future
more detailed analyses with focus on reconcilling the differences between the
modelled and observed characteristics, and eventually on its climatic impact
and predictability.

Methodology 
</H2>

<OL>
<LI> To examine the phase-locking of oceanic and atmospheric anomalies, the 
project will construct Hovmoeller diagrams of anomalies  of SST and PSL and 
examine their interrelationship.

<LI> To examine the dominance of a specific wavenumber-pattern, correlation 
analysis  following WP, or/and by applications of empirical orthogonal 
function analysis will be performed. This will provide time series of the
pattern index (temporal cofficient in the case of EOF analysis).

<LI> To examine any possible connection with the variability in the tropics, 
lag correlation between the pattern index and time series of Nino3 SST anomaly
(or southern oscillation index) will be performed.
