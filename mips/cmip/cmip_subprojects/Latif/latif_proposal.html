<p>
Recent observational and modelling studies report a weakening of
the shallow tropical cells (STCs) in the Pacific Ocean,
and this may have been the cause of the warming in the
equatorial Pacific observed over the last decades (McPhaden and
Zhang 2002). The STCs control the upwelling at the equator
and thus a changing STC strength has a direct impact on the SST, which
may be reinforced by coupled feedbacks. As such, the STCs may
play an important role in regional and global climate change.
Furthermore, a change in the STCs may also affect ENSO variability.
<p>
We would like to explore the sensitivity of these cells
to global warming. The background is that two different models
developed at the Max-Planck-Institute simulate rather different
responses. The situation may be similar to the problem of the
stability of the thermohaline circulation (THC):
The ensemble of CMIP models shows a large
spread in the behavior of the THC when forced by increased
levels of greenhouse gases. Our subproject is aiming at
quantifying the spread in the Pacific STC behavior within
the CMIP2 model ensemble.
<p>
Variables needed from the CMIP database:
<ol>
<li> 20 year means of the overturning in the Pacific from the control integrations,
<li> 20 year means of the overturning in the Pacific from the 1% integrations.
</ol>
