Based upon recent analysis of myself and other
scientists (Liu et al., 2001), the PCM 1.1 has
simulated a reasonable historical dry climatology
of the Sahara Desert in the twentieth century.
This coupled climate model also predicted a
drying, warming, shrinking, and northward
retreating desert during the 21st century in the
business as usual scenario of global greenhouse
gases increasing.  Could other modern coupled
climate models produce a similar or even more
realistic dry climatology over the Desert?
Will these models predict similar future climate
change of the Sahara in the background of global
warming?  Or even the arid and semi-arid climate
change all over the world?  An intercomparison
of CMIP2+ coupled models on these puzzles seems
necessary and scientific.
Some observational data
sources in hand such as Xie and Arkin rainfall,
IPCC rainfall and NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data etc.
will be used as references.
