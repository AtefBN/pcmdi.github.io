The equatorial cold-tongue is a salient feature in the sea surface temperature
(SST) distribution
in the tropical Pacific. It corresponds to a region with dry
subsiding air and thereby serves as a "radiator fin". The intensity of the
cold-tongue also
determines the heat flux into the ocean. Therefore, the cold-tongue plays a
fundamental role in
heat balance of the ocean-atmosphere system in the tropics and beyond.
Moreover, the intensity of the equatorial cold-tongue varies substantially
on the seasonal,
interannual, and longer time-scales. These variations affect
climate world-wide including the climate over the continental US.
<p>
The physics controlling the intensity of the equatorial cold-tongue,
however, has not
been fully understood. This lack of understanding is reflected in the
inability of current coupled
GCMs to simulate correctly the intensity of the equatorial
cold-tongue. A cold-bias in the equatorial Pacific SST is a common problem
in coupled GCMs without
the use of flux adjustment, and a major contributor to
the double ITCZ syndrome in the these GCMs. The NCAR CCSM, arguably the
most frequently used
climate system model by climate researchers
world-wide, also suffers severely from this problem.
<p>
The almost ubiquitous presence of the excessive cold-tongue in the coupled
models may also offer
a unique opportunity to understand the nature of the problem and thereby to
better understand the dynamics
and thermodynamics controlling the intensity of the equatorial cold-tongue.
This is because hypotheses
developed from a particular model can be readily tested against the output
from another coupled model.
The Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) and the earlier
Atmospheric Model Inter-comparison
Project
(AMIP) have  in fact long envisioned this approach and accordingly
coordinated groups to conduct runs with the same or very similar boundary
conditions so that
inter-comparison studies can be maximumly facilitated (Meehl et al. 2000).
<p>
In light of a recent analysis of the feedbacks over the cold-tongue region
in the NCAR CCM3--the
atmospheric component (Sun et al. 2003), we hypothesize that the cloud and
water vapor feedbacks play a
fundamental role in
determining the intensity of the cold-tongue and that the excessive
cold-tongue in many coupled GCMs may
be partially due to common errors in the direct and indirect effects of
water vapor and cloud forcing.
More specifically, if a model overestimates the water vapor feedback and
underestimates the negative feedback
from the short-wave forcing of clouds, the net atmospheric feedback may be
less negative than the observed value.
Consequently, even if ocean feedback is perfectly simulated, a drift in the
coupled model will be less constrained
by the model atmosphere than by the real atmosphere.
Clearly, this hypothesis can
be tested to a significant degree by comparing the feedbacks in other
coupled models with the
feedbacks in the NCAR CCSM. In any case, the analysis of the feedbacks in
different coupled models may
help us to gain confidence in the projection of global warming by these
models because these feedbacks also
control the sensitivity of the climate system to an external perturbation.
<p>
With AMIP runs, we will first quantify the radiative and dynamical
feedbacks over the equatorial Pacific cold-tongue region, using the El Nino
warming as the forcing signal.
The observational data will be from ERBE, CERES, ISCCP, and the NCEP
reanalysis.
We will then examine the equilibrium tropical Pacific climate of the
corresponding coupled models to check
whether there is a general correspondence between the severity of the
cold-bias in the equatorial Pacific SST
and the degree of errors in the water vapor and cloud feedbacks. In
conjunction with this analysis, we will
examine the surface winds, the upper ocean thermal structure, and the upper
ocean circulation in the tropical
Pacific with a focus on the aspects that are directly relevant to the
intensity of the equatorial Pacific cold-tongue.
<p>
We will need the following model outputs:
<ol>
<li> Fluxes at the TOA and at the surface from AMIP2 runs
<li> Surface wind-stress  from the AMIP2 runs
<li> Upper ocean temperature from the forced ocean runs and/or coupled runs.
    We will be only looking at the subsurface temperature down to the 400 m
    and over the equatorial Pacific.
