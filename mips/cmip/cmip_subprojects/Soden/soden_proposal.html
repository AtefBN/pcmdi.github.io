<P>
I am interested in examining the coupling between changes in the 
hydrologic and energy budgets from the CMIP II simulations. It is
known that GCM predictions of the change in global-mean precipitation
at the time of doubled CO2 differ by nearly a factor of 4 from one
model to the next. On a global mean, the changes in the precipitation are
determined by changes in surface evaporation. These associated changes in 
latent heat flux are, in turn, balanced by changes in other components of
the surface energy budget; i.e., IR, solar and sensible heat fluxes.
<P>
Thus, intermodel differences in the response of precipitation to global warming
are intimately linked to differences in the surface heat flux. It is our
objective to better understand the cause of intermodel differences in 
the response of the hydrologic cycle to increasing CO2 by examining how they
are related to changes in the surface energy budget. We hope to identify 
which components of the surface heat fluxes (IR, solar, sensible) balance 
the changes in evaporative heat flux. This work aims to build upon a
recent paper (Soden, 2000: "The Sensitivity of the Tropical Hydrologic Cycle
to ENSO", J. Climate, <B>13</B>, 538-549) which identified significant discrepancies
between AMIP I model simulations and satellite observations of the 
variability of tropical-mean precipitation and surface IR heat flux. 
In particular, the CMIP model archive provides the perfect opportunity to 
examine intermodel differences in surface heat fluxes and their
connection to changes in the intensity of the hydrological cycle. 
<P>
This work requires the following variables which are available from CMIP II:
<UL>
   <LI>    Geographical variations:
   <UL>
	<LI> surface net IR
	<LI> surface net solar
	<LI> surface latent heat flux
	<LI> surface sensible heat flux
	<LI> net surface heat flux at the air-sea interface
	<LI> flux adjustments
   </UL>
   <LI>    Time series:
   <UL>
	<LI> precipitation
   </UL>
</UL>
<P>
In addition, to better understand how the changes in the hydrologic/energy
budgets are linked to changes in the circulation/lapse-rate we also request:
<UL>
   <LI>     Zonal Mean:
   <UL>
	<LI> u-component wind
	<LI> v-component wind
	<LI> temperature
	<LI> moisture
   </UL>
</UL>
