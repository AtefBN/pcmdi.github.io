<H2> Background to intended research </H2>

<P>
      I am working on El Nino since January 1993.

       I have realized coupled GCM simulations: global atmospheric model
       ARPEGE from CNRM with either Pacific ocean model OPA6 or global ocean
       model OPA7 from LODYC. I have especially focused my analysis on ENSO
       events.
       I have used the "Zebiak and Cane" model.
       I have developed a theoretical approach to El Nino. This work have
       allowed to exhibit full analytical expressions of coupled processes
       which could be involved in the El Nino onsets.

      The originality of my work is to study the results of coupled GCM
      from the theoretical coupled processes point of view.
<P>
      I am now in charge of the coupled-GCM CoPIVEP (Coupled Processes and
      Interannual Variability in the Equatorial Pacific) intercomparison.
      The following laboratories participate in CoPIVEP:
       <OL>
       <LI> Max-Planck Institute fur Meteorologie, Germany
       <LI> IPSL (LODYC+LMD), France
       <LI> CERFACS, France
       <LI> Meteorological Research Institute /JMA, Japan
       <LI> UGAMP, United-Kingdom, (when data will be available)
       <LI> UCLA, USA, (when data will be available)
       <LI> CCSR, University of Tokyo, Japan
       <LI> UKMO, United_Kingdom (probably)
       </OL>
      The data of the 3 first laboratories are now processed and the results
      will be presented at the EGS conference (April 97, Wien).
      CoPIVEP is not linked to an official project. It is
      just the wish of the group "cgsg-mail@titian.atmos.ucla.edu" and
      mainly of Mechoso and Philander.
<P>
     The second topic of my work is about the role of the westerly wind
     bursts in the onsets of El Nino. This work is co-superintended by
     Jean-Luc Redelsperger (CNRM, TOGA-COARE) and me, with the collaboration
     of Pascale Delecluse (LODYC).


<H2> Objectives </H2>

<P> I propose 2 levels of diagnosis:

<P><B>  Level 1:  "Documentation of the Interannual Varibility" (DIV) </B>
<BR>
       I propose to perform EOF (and Complex EOF) with the interannual
       monthly mean atmospheric surface temperature.
           I will perform also the time spectrum analysis for the whole data
       and for each EOF.  [Some other analysis can be possible as the
       time-space analysis (wavelets - ondelettes in French).]
       Depending on the available data, the characteristic zonal structure
       of the interannual signals will be precised (phase lag between SST,
       oceanic currents, wind stresses).

<P><B>  Level 2:  "COupled Processes"  (COP) </B>
<BR>
           With the available data (annual and seasonal mean state), it is
       possible to compute the theoritical efficiencies  of some coupled
       processes for the whole Pacific basin. The objectives will be:
<UL>
       <LI>to find an eventual link between the mean state and the nature
       of the interannual signal.
       <LI>to find an eventual link between the cGCM configuration
       (parameterization, resolution, coupling ...) and the dominant
       coupled processes.
       <LI>to find an eventual link between the seasonal variation of
       the basic state and the seasonal phase lock of the El Nino onsets
       (if there is).
</UL>


<H2> Methodology </H2>

<P>
       For the level 1: we have on our computers a scientific library which
            provides the necessary statistical functions.
<P>
       For the level 2: the programs have been already developped for
            CoPIVEP but they will be adapted to the CMIP data.
<P>
       Validation: For CoPIVEP, I already use the SST of COLA-CAC
            [and Levitus for the 3D temperature: annual mean and
            seasonal mean]. I will need of measurenments of vertical
            velocity in the 0-100m layer (TAO-array ?).
            All informations about other observation data sets will
            be wellcome.

<H2> Data requirements </H2>

<P>       For level 1: monthly mean of SST or atmospheric surface
            temperature (AST).  If possible, also wind stresses,
            oceanic surface currents.

<P>       For level 2:  total-simulation mean and seasonal (at least DJF,MAM,
                     JJA,SON) mean of the SST (or AST), and the latitude-
                     vertical cross section of the oceanic temperature and
             vertical velocity. (The best would be the 3D data in
             the Pacific bassin).

<P>
      David Stephenson (sub-project North Atlantic Oscillation)
      is now working in the CNRM (200 meters from my location) and we have
      working together for 2 years at CERFACS (in the Climate Modelling and
      Global Change team). We can interact to use the CMIP data.
