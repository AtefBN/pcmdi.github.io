<P> The present subproject has two objectives:
<OL> 
<LI> To study the role of
air-sea interaction in affecting the GCM simulations of EAC
<LI> To study the decadal
climate variability over east China using both long-term CGCM
simulations and proxy data of temperature and precipitation
</OL> 
<H2> Air-Sea Interaction </H2>
<P> 
Within the AMIP (Subproject #25), SUNYA has conducted
"GCM-to-observation" and "GCM-to-GCM" comparisons with focus on
systematic errors of climatological mean and variability of AGCMs'
simulated east Asia climate (EAC).  The models are capable of
reproducing the observed large-scale features, but exhibit significant
biases in simulating the seasonal precipitation characteristics (Liang
et al., 1997; Samel et al., 1996), especially the magnitudes and
locations of maximum precipitation, and their time evolution during
summer (Wang et al., 1997a).
<P> 
When averaged over 105E-122E, there exist two peaks in the observed
latitudinal distribution of May monthly mean rainfall across 10S-45N.
The maximum (~8mm/day) occurs at the equator and around 22N, and both
peaks are associated with strong positive vertical motions.  In June,
the two peaks merge as a result of the northward movement of ITCZ; the
peak value of 9 mm/day rainfall covers a broader latitudinal zone and
is identified with greatly enhanced upward motion (versus May).  For
AMIP models, for example, NCAR-CCM3 catches the two-peaks structure in
May, although the equatorial peak has a larger value and the
midlatitude rainfall peak is located further to the north at 32N.  In
addition, the model fails to simulate the northward movement of the
ITCZ so that the two rainfall systems appear to be stationary and do
not merge in June.  Note that these features are consistent with a lack
of strong vertical motion, in particular in South China Sea.  It is
interesting to find that this model bias is significantly reduced when
CCM3 is coupled with an ocean circulation model.  For example, the
vertical motion and precipitation over 10-20N are much enhanced, thus
reflecting the importance of <I>air-sea interaction</I> in
influencing the precipitation over east Asia.
 
<H2> Decadal Climate Variability </H2>
<P> 
We have been analyzing the 1471-1950 flood/drought proxy data over
eastern China to study decadal climate variability (Liang et al., 1995;
Wang et al., 1997b) and to compare the results with those simulated
from 1000-years GFDL CGCM simulations of precipitation.  [Note that the
proxy data contain implicit changes in climate forcing (such as
volcanic eruptions, greenhouse gases) while the model simulation,
although without climate forcing changes, has inherent variability
associated with internal dynamics of the climate system.]  Similar
interannual and <bold>decadal variability </bold>in the dominant
patterns of north-south and south-central-north precipitation
characteristics were found, although the model shows less variability
than the proxy data.
 
<H2> Methodology </H2>
<UL> 
<LI>
<I> Air-sea interaction: </I>
We plan to compare the surface heat balance components between the AMIP
(specified SST) and CMIP (calculated SST) runs, in particular over the
region of low latitude western Pacific.  The differences in the latent
heat, sensible heat, and longwave and shortwave radiative fluxes
between these two types of SST treatment will provide information on
the role of air-sea interaction.
<LI>
<I> Decadal climate variability: </I>
We plan to expand the comparison of decadal climate variability to
include other CMIP model simulations, such as the simulations from
NCAR, MPI and UK Hadley Center.
</UL> 
 
<H2> Data Requirements </H2>
<P> 
For air-sea interaction, we need time-averaged surface heat balance
components (latent, sensible and longwave and shortwave radiative
fluxes) and surface wind, surface air temperature and SST.
<P> 
For decadal climate variability, we need monthly mean time series of
precipitation and temperature over eastern China.  We plan also to use
the 2xCO2 simulated temperature and precipitation to compare the
changes in climate variability.  In addition, at a latter stage, we
need to compare the soil moisture if the CMIP data are available.
