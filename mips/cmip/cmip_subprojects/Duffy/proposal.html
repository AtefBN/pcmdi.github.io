<H2> Introduction </H2>
<P>
The climate simulated by coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation 
climate models often drifts away from the present-day climate, even 
under constant present-day forcing.  Flux adjustments (a.k.a. flux 
"corrections") are unphysical sources of heat, moisture, and momentum 
used in coupled GCMs to prevent this problem.  The possibility that
flux adjustments inadvertently distort other features of model  
simulations is a subject of vigorous debate [1 - 2].  Do flux 
adjustments suppress not only unrealistic climate drift but also 
natural climate variability in models?  We aim to examine this 
question by looking for a relationship between the strength of flux 
adjustments and the interannual variability in the CMIP climate model 
control runs.
<P>
If flux adjustments do suppress climate variability in models, then 
-- all else being equal -- the models that use stronger adjustments 
should have less climate variability.  Of course many other factors 
affect variability in climate models, and these factors differ among 
models.  The CMIP data base, however, includes a large population of 
both flux-adjusted (9) and non-flux-adjusted (8) models.  Any 
significant systematic influence of flux adjustment should be 
apparent if enough models are analyzed.
<P>
Although several CMIP subprojects [3] and other studies [e.g., 4] are
actively investigating climate model variability, to our knowledge no
other group is studying its relationship with flux adjustment in a
large population of models.

<H2> Proposed Work </H2>
<P>
We propose to look for a relationship between the magnitudes of heat 
flux correction and surface air temperature variability in the 
CMIP climate model "control" runs.  We will focus on interannual-to-decadal 
and longer timescale variability.  (Since most flux-adjusted
models use adjustments that vary seasonally, it is not expected that 
flux adjustments will suppress the seasonal cycle.  This supposition 
is verified in work by one of us [Covey] on the seasonal cycle in 
CMIP1 models.)
<P>
In preliminary work, we examined the relationship between variance 
of globally and annually averaged surface air temperature, and the
presence or absence of flux adjustment, for the 17 CMIP models 
mentioned above.  The average of surface air temperature variance is
0.008 K<SUP>2</SUP> for flux-adjusted models and 0.011 K<SUP>2</SUP> 
for non-flux-adjusted 
models.  It is not clear that this small difference between
the two classes of models is significant.  However, taking a global 
mean before any other analysis is done has the effect of suppressing
a great deal of the variability in the models.  We propose to use a
more sensible (and compute-intensive) measure of variability such as 
the global mean of interannual grid-point variance.  We also propose
to similarly measure the magnitude of heat-flux adjustment for each
model, and to correlate this quantity with the amount of surface air
temperature variability.
<P>
We believe that either way our results turn out -- i.e., whether or 
not there is a substantial correlation between flux adjustment and 
interannual variability in the CMIP population of models -- we will
reach a significant conclusion about modern coupled GCMs.
