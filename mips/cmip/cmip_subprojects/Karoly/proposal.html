<p>Some early studies of global climate change sought to identify significant
changes in global mean surface temperature and to attribute such changes
to human influences. However, cause and effect are difficult to identify
unequivocally in such a simple globally-averaged measure. More recent climate
change attribution studies have focussed on fingerprint methods, which
make use of the spatial patterns of temperature change to try to attribute
the observed changes to one or more climate forcing factors. However, fingerprint
methods also make use of more complex multi-variate statistics and the
results may be harder to interpret or to communicate than those using global
mean temperature.
<p>In this project, we seek to compare the internal climate variability
in a number of climate model control simulations with the climate changes
in transient greenhouse simulations using a small number of global indices.
These indices have been selected based on earlier studies of climate change
detection and on some of the key features identified in the climate change
fingerprints that have been used commonly. They include global mean temperature,
global mean temperature contrast between land and ocean, mean inter-hemispheric
temperature contrast, the mean meridional temperature gradient between
high and low latitudes, and the mean magnitude of the seasonal temperature
cycle and of the diurnal temperature cycle on land.
<p>The Lead Authors of Chapter 2 "Observed Climate Change" of IPCC TAR
are producing the following indices and an observed data mask (in additional
to time series of global mean temperature):
<ol>
<li>
Land-Ocean temperature difference time series</li>

<li>
Winter-Summer temperature difference time series (both hemispheres)</li>

<li>
N.H./S.H. temperature difference time series</li>

<li>
Diurnal temperature range time series</li>

<li>
700 mb/50 mb temperature difference time series</li>

<li>
Upper ten percentile of daily precipitation events time series (based on
a fixed threshold for each grid cell)</li>

<li>
Zonal temp differences 20S-20N - 50-70N.</li>
</ol>
We propose to compute time series of the global mean temperature and indices
1, 2, 3, and 7 above from the time series of monthly mean surface air temperature
from the long control simulations and the transient greenhouse simulations
available in CMIP2. The model time series will be computed using an observed
data mask consistent with that used in IPCC.
<p>Estimates of the natural variability of these indices from the control
simulations will be compared between models. Preliminary analysis has shown
that several of these indices are nearly independent. The correlations
between the indices in each model's control simulation will be compared
between the different models. The trends in these indices in the transient
greenhouse simulations will be compared between models and with the control
simulations.
<p>It is expected that the combination of these simple global indices will
have more power to detect and attribute climate change than does the use
of global mean temperature alone.
