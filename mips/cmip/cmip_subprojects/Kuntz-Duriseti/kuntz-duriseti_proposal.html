In my dissertation I integrate a precautionary saving model from
economics into the Nordhaus (1994) DICE integrated assessment model (IAM).
I demonstrate that uncertainty over future climate change scenarios
introduces an additional precautionary motive for greater greenhouse gas
abatement beyond risk aversion.  Current assessments may identify a range
of possible "states of the world" (SOW) in order to evaluate policy
responses.  These analyses are limited because they are generally
restricted to only a few SOW and/or time periods (e.g. before and
after policy action; before and after uncertainty resolution) due to the
complexity of following many SOW over several time periods).  The specific
representation of the "precautionary principle" I propose reflects the
<i>range</i> of current expert knowledge regarding future climate change
(i.e., the AOGCM model simulations) and incorporates this into existing
IAMs through a relatively transparent parameterization.  In order to
perform this analysis, I request access to the CMIP simulation data on
globally averaged temperature, including the data on the ensemble mean
across all simulations, used in figure 9.3 of IPCC TAR Ch. 9.  Using this
data, I will create a time series for the variance of the simulations
which I will incorporate into my analysis.
