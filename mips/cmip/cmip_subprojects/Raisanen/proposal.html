Background</H2>
Northern Europe is an area where many climate models suggest a rather strong
response to increased greenhouse gas concentrations, in particular as regards
wintertime temperatures (e.g., Raisanen 1994). On the other hand, the observed
interannual and interdecadal variations of climate are also large in this
region. Furthermore, the location near the western margin of the Eurasian
continent and the importance of the Gulf Stream may make the climate in
Northern Europe sensitive to changes in both the atmospheric and the oceanic
circulation.

<P>The Swedish regional Climate Modelling Program (SWECLIM; http://www.smhi.se/
sgn0106/rossby/index-e.htm), within which the proposed research would be
conducted, has as one of its main aims the production of high-resolution
climate scenarios for northern Europe by using a regional climate model
that takes its boundary conditions from a global OAGCM. To get an idea
of the associated uncertainties, it is of vital importance to also study
the behavior of other OAGCMs in the same area.
<H1>
Objectives</H1>
We aim at 1) documenting the similarities and differences between the response
of different OAGCMs to increased CO2 in the Nordic area and 2) studying,
in particular, the importance of internal climate variability in interpreting
the model results. To the extent that the available data allow, we will
also try to 3) achieve some physical understanding on the intermodel differences
in the simulated climate changes. Apart from SWECLIM, the results are expected
to be of interest for the climate modelling community in general.
<H1>
Methodology</H1>
To document the intermodel similarities and differences in the simulated
response to increasing CO2, all model results will be interpolated to a
common grid representative of the typical resolution of the models. Following
Raisanen (1997a;b), the intermodel agreement will be quantified in both
area-averaged sense (e.g., area mean changes in temperature and precipitation
in different models; pairwise centred and/or uncentred spatial cross correlations
for different model pairs) and in individual grid boxes (ratio of the intermodel
mean change to the intermodel standard deviation; total fraction of models
that simulate a change to a given direction).

<P>The amplitude of internal variability in the models will be estimated
from the 80-year control simulations, using, for example, the standard
deviation of 16 non-overlapping 5-year means. For each model, the statististical
significance of the simulated climate changes against internal variability
will be characterized (e.g.) by the standard t statistics. It will be studied
1) at which stage of the experiment, if any, the CO2-induced changes in
different variables reach statistical significance in different models,
and 2) how this depends on the spatial (individual grid boxes vs. area
means) and temporal scale (monthly/seasonal/annual means) considered.

<P>An implicit way for assessing the relative importance of internal variability
for intermodel differences in the simulated climate changes is to repeat
the quantification of intermodel agreement with different averaging periods.
For example, the same statistics might be calculated using 5-, 10-, 20-
and 40-year periods centred at year 60. Another, more explicit method,
applied to one model pair by Raisanen (1997b;1998), is to repeat the statistical
comparisons neglecting those grid boxes and models in which the significance
of the simulated changes is weak. Furthermore, the variance between the
simulated climate changes in different models may be compared with the
expected value of the variance resulting from internal variability alone.

<P>If all intermodel differences in the response to increased CO2 cannot
be explained by internal variability, some clues of the possible other
reasons may be gained by comparing the CO2-induced changes between different
variables and with the control climates. For example, simulated temperature
changes in northern Europe might be correlated between models with the
simulated time mean change in the NAO pressure pattern or in the strength
of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation, or with temperatures in
the control run.
<H1>
Data requirements</H1>
This analysis requires, at least, the 80-year (control and greenhouse run)
monthly time series of surface air temperature, precipitation and sea level
pressure. For physical interpretation, the following 20-year mean fields
given in the CMIP II data request list are also of interest: (I.a.i) snow
cover, surface latent and sensible heat flux, net solar and IR radiation;
(II.i) the North Atlantic meridional overturning streamfunction; (II.iv)
sea ice thickness and concentration. Although our focus is regional, having
global data seems beneficial, both for the physical interpretation and
because some of the more mechanical calculations might be for comparison
conducted for other regions of the world.
