The primary goal of the Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics Program
<A HREF = "http://www.globec.org/">
(GLOBEC; http://www.globec.org)</A> 
is to advance our understanding
of the structure and functioning of the global ocean ecosystem,
its major subsystems, and its response to physical forcing so
that a capability can be developed to forecast the responses of
the marine ecosystem to global change.  The main objective of the
proposed research will be to examine the possible responses of
zooplankton and higher trophic levels to climate change scenarios
at decadal and longer time-scales predicted by the GCMs.
