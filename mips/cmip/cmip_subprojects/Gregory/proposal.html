Some of the experiments submitted to the IPCC DDC have included or will include
information about global-average thermal expansion. Since these experiments
have been run with similar scenarios (historical CO2 to 1990, then IS92a or
1%), these results will be comparable, and that is useful. However, it is
not sufficient to quantify the uncertainty in thermal expansion, because it
doesn't separate the effects of differing climate sensitivity and heat uptake
processes.
<P>
To get some information about this, I'd like to have a look at some CMIP
data, since some of the models concerned are the same, and from the range
of models one could get an idea about the systematic uncertainty. Analyses
which would be useful are:
<UL>
<LI> From the 3D temperature and salinity fields, I would calculate the global
heat uptake and the global average thermal expansion (assuming a common
equation of state). This would show how consistent an indicator the thermal
expansion is of the heat uptake. They are not necessarily proportional
because of the effect of T and S on thermal expansivity. However, I suspect
that in practice they may be related in a similar way for different models.

<LI> Using the net heat flux into the ocean, which will probably be similar to
the net heat flux at the TOA for 20-year means (since the heat capacity of
land and atmosphere is small) and assuming a value for the radiative forcing
of 2*CO2, I would compare the relative influences of climate feedback and
heat uptake on determining the rate of climate change, as John and I did for
HADCM2 in Geophys Res Lett 24 (1997) 1943-1946, where we compared the time-
development of climate change in 1% experiments using HADCM2 with and without
flux adjustment. We found then that
   <UL>
   <LI> The heat flux into the ocean was roughly proportional to the temperature
change, so could be expressed as a linear term, like the climate feedback.
(This would only work for a linearly increasing forcing, I expect.)

   <LI> Both this coupling and the climate feedback were different in the two
models.
Moreover, the differences were of equal importance in bringing about the
different rates of climate change.

It is the final point which bears upon the question of how the rate of sea-
level rise will be related to the rate of temperature rise, and it would be
interesting to know whether a similar analysis works for other CMIP models.
