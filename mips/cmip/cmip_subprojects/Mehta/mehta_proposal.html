<H2> Background </H2>
<P>
There is an increasing awareness in the scientific community about decadal
climate variability phenomena in the tropical-subtropical  Atlantic (Moura and
Shukla, 1981; Hastenrath, 1990, 1991; Mehta and Delworth, 1995; Hansen and
Bezdek, 1996; Delworth and Mehta, 1998; Rajagopalan et al., 1998; Mehta, 1998;
Enfield et al., 1999; Tourre et al., 1999; Yang, 1999; Dommenget and Latif,
2000) and Pacific (Mann and Park, 1996; Mantua et al., 1997; White et al.,
1997; Zhang Y. et al., 1997; Zhang R. and Levitus, 1997; Latif et al., 1997;
Nakamura et al., 1997; Nakamura and Yamagata, 1999; Zhang R., 1998; White and
Cayan, 1998; Pierce et al., 2000; Mehta, 2001); the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool
(Mehta and Mehta, 2001); modulations of ENSO (Balmaseda et al., 1995) and its
climate impacts (Gershunov and Barnett, 1998; Power et al., 1999, Mehta and
Suarez, 2001); modulations of interannual ENSO-monsoon relationship (Mehta and
Lau, 1997; Kumar et al., 1999; Krishnamurthy and Goswami, 2000; Gershunov et
al., 2001; ); and variations/trends in the North Atlantic Oscillation
(Hurrell, 1995; Thompson and Wallace, 1998; Rodwell et al., 1999; Mehta et
al., 2000; Latif et al., 2000).  These and other such phenomena appear to
influence, to varying degrees, regional and/or global climate.  These
phenomena can also potentially interfere in the detection and quantification
of climate change, especially at sub-continental scales, due to increasing CO2
in the Earth-atmosphere system.  Therefore, it is very important to understand
mechanisms of such phenomena, quantify  their predictability, and ascertain
the likely influence of increasing CO2 on these phenomena and their
predictability.  Global coupled models can be very useful tools in these
studies.    The century-long (or longer) runs of the CMIP2+ global coupled
models can be especially useful because these models are also used to estimate
future climate change in various scenarios of increasing CO2.
<H2> Objectives </H2>
<P>
        There are three major objectives of the proposed work:
<OL>
<LI> to determine characteristics (time scales, spatial patterns, evolution,
association with other phenomena) of the decadal climate phenomena mentioned
above and compare them with the observed characteristics of these phenomena,
<LI> to estimate how these characteristics might change as functions of
increasing CO2, and
<LI> to attempt to relate inter-model differences in the results to model
formulations.
</OL>
<H2> Methodology </H2>
<P>
It is proposed to analyse  variability of model sea surface temperatures
(SSTs) from the control runs first to compare with the observed SST
variability in the above-mentioned decadal phenomena.  Spatial patterns, time
scales, and evolution of decadal SST anomalies will be analyzed, using various
spectrum analysis and space-time structure analysis techniques such as
Fourier, Singular, Wavelet, Multi-Taper, SVD and other types of EOF analysis,
space-time lag-correlation, and composites.  These results will then be
compared with corresponding results from the observed SST analyses.
If there are significant, decadal spectral peaks, there may be specific
processes responsible for generating the spectral peaks.  To study these
processes, SST, sub-surface ocean temperature and velocity fields;
ocean-atmosphere momentum, heat and freshwater fluxes; and atmospheric fields
will be bandpass-filtered and the evolution of the anomalies will be studied.
Horizontal and vertical propagations of ocean heat content signals, if any,
will also be studied in conjunction with the ocean-atmosphere fluxes  to see
whether the decadal signals in SSTs precede or follow decadal signals in
surface fluxes and upper-ocean heat content.  This may shed some light on
whether the atmosphere forces the SST signal or whether the ocean also plays
an important role in it.
<P>
Results from the models will be compared with SST observations from the Global
Ocean surface Temperature Atlas (GOSTA; Bottomley et al., 1990), the Global
sea-Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (GISST; Rayner et al., 1996), the HadISST,
reconstructed SST data from Kaplan et al. (1998), and the model-assimilated
ocean data from the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) system.  The
atmospheric componet of the results will be compared with corresponding
results from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalyses data sets.   Simulated rainfall
variability will be compared with rainfall data from Dai et al. (1997) and
Hulme et al. (1999).
<P>
These analyses will also be performed on the model data from the increasing
CO2 runs and also on data from varying solar radiation runs if such runs will
be available.
