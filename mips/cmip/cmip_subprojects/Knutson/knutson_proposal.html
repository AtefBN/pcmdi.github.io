<H2> Background </H2>
<P>
One concern about future climate change is that the 
intensity of tropical cyclones could increase due to the 
warmer SSTs predicted by coupled climate models forced 
by increasing greenhouse gases.   To explore this problem, 
the GFDL hurricane prediction system, a regional triply 
nested moveable mesh hurricane model with initialization 
system, has been utilized in combination with GFDL global 
climate model data (Knutson and Tuleya 1999).  A set of 
idealized hurricane experiments have been performed 
where a weak tropical storm is initialized in a favorable 
tropical environment with uniform easterly flow (no wind 
shear or land) and allowed to intensity to a quasi-steady 
state intensity.  The SSTs, atmospheric temperature, and 
atmospheric moisture environmental states for these high 
resolution experiments have been derived from climate 
experiments (control and high CO2) from a GFDL coupled 
model, using time and area means for various tropical 
storm basins.  The storms simulated for the high CO2 
environments typically have been slightly stronger (~5-10 
percent higher maximum surface wind speeds) than for the 
control (present day) environments. 
<P>
An important factor controlling hurricane intensity in 
these experiments (besides SST) is the vertical profile of 
the temperature changes throughout the troposphere.   The 
enhanced warming in the upper troposphere, relative to the 
surface warming, acts to limit the amount of storm 
intensification simulated (Shen et al. 1999).  Since only the 
GFDL coupled model environmental states have been used 
to date, the question arises as to what type of changes 
would be simulated using simulated future 
atmospheric/SST conditions from other climate models.

<H2> Objectives </H2>
<P>
The objective of this subproject  is to explore how 
sensitive the hurricane intensity simulation results of 
Knutson and Tuleya (1999) are to the choice of GCM used 
for the environmental state.  Do the thermodynamic states 
simulated by various CMIP2+ models imply more 
intensification, less intensification, or even weakening of 
future hurricanes according to this methodology?

<H2> Methodology </H2>
<P>
We propose to derive time- and area-averaged SST, 
air temperature, and moisture profiles from the 
participating CMIP2+ models over the various tropical 
storm basins and perform idealized hurricane model 
experiments with those environmental states.  
<P>
Using the monthly climatologies of SST, temperature, 
and moisture for control and high CO2 conditions from the 
various models, the tropical storm basin environmental 
states and their CO2-induced changes will be obtained and 
compared graphically.  Some CAPE or Maximum Potential 
Intensity (MPI) calculations may be done on these profiles.  
The main activity of the subproject will be to use these 
profiles as input for idealized experiments using the GFDL 
hurricane model following the methodology of Knutson 
and Tuleya (1999) although without ocean coupling 
(Knutson et al. 2001).  The climate model-derived fields 
are used as reference boundary conditions at the central 
latitude of the east-west channel in which an idealized 
initial disturbance is placed in the hurricane model.  The 
surface pressure and temperature fields for the hurricane 
model environment are computed at the end of the initial 
vortex insertion procedure by solving a form of the reverse 
balance equation. Aside from the disturbance vortex, the 
environmental flow will be specified as an easterly flow 
(~5m/sec) that is uniform with height.  An ensemble (~10) 
of experiments will be run for each model/basin/CO2 
condition in order to separate the actual simulated climate 
"signal" from internal variability "noise" in the model 
responses.  
<P>
The hurricane model will likely be run using its 
current operational configuration in terms of resolution 
(maximum of about 18 km) and physics, although 
experiments using enhanced resolution or physics may be 
attempted. 
<P>   
The hurricane model simulations will be analyzed in 
particular with regard to maximum storm intensity 
(minimum central surface pressure or maximum surface 
wind speed) and precipitation (storm maximum or near-
storm area average).  Some evaluation of the hurricane 
model's simulated intensities has been done for "present 
climate" conditions (Knutson et al. 1998; Knutson and 
Tuleya 1999), although this remains an important research 
issue to address.
