The LMD/IPSL has recently started a collaboration with economists within
the French CIRED (Centre International de Recherche sur l'Environnement et
le Developpement - a CNRS laboratory), and in particular with its
director, J.C. Hourcade, who has been a lead author in several chapters of
the IPCC Report (Group III). This collaboration aims at evaluating the
impact of climate change, and the strategies to mitigate it. Several
impact models will be considered within this collaboration, ranging from
simple models (e.g., DIAM) to relatively detailed ones (e.g., IMAGE). All
of these "integrated models" attempt to link physical and economical
aspects of global climate changes.  A common challenge for them is to
incorporate the uncertainties of climate model scenarios into their
climate change damage estimates.
<P>
Uncertainties in climate model simulations are related to both model
deficiencies and fundamental problems (partial unpredictability of the
system).  The spread between the different climate model simulations is
arguably one of the best measures currently available to estimate
uncertainties in climate projections.  The CMIP data base offers a unique
opportunity to document at least part of those uncertainties, because
similar experiments have been made with a wide range of models.
<P>
Further study and development of integrated models is clearly needed.  In
this study we seek to evaluate a variety of integrated model damage
estimates over selected regions, making use of the CMIP data base to
estimate uncertainties in climate simulation scenarios.
<P>
The CMIP data base will be used as follows:  Monthly mean precipitation
and surface temperature will be analyzed from both 1xCO2 and 2xCO2
scenarios. The mean response (average over the different models), the
range of the response (the standard deviation across models), and the
extremes will be evaluated.  These measures (not the individual
simulations)  will be used for our study of a suite of impact models.
<P>
CMIP data requirements:  Monthly mean precipitation and surface air
temperature.
